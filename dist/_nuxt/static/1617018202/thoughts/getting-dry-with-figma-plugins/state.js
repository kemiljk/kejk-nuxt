Just like all creative rules though, sometimes breaking them leads to more intriguing results, and this is very common when using the rule of thirds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn design we can use the rule of thirds when \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fdesignwebkit.com\u002Fweb-design\u002Frule-of-thirds-web-design\u002F\"\u003Elaying out a website or app\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, or when composing an article. It can often help us to pair the notion of the rule of thirds with grid\r\nlayouts. Pairing the two can lead to interesting and dynamic layouts whilst maintaining logic and legibility.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn music we can use the rule of thirds in many ways, mostly it&rsquo;s a logical way to think about breaking up a composition. Take a traditional \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.teenstarcompetition.co.uk\u002Fadvice\u002Fhow-to-write-a-pop-song\"\u003Epop song\u003C\u002Fa\u003E: intro, verse,\r\nchorus, verse, chorus, bridge, middle eight, chorus. Here, to create the catchy moment people always look forward to in songs, often the end of a pop song leverages the idea of using a bridge, then a middle eight (which is often a stripped down version\r\nof the same chorus melody) and then ending with a big final chorus. This use of a triad is one of the major reasons pop songs feel so catchy, they&rsquo;re predictable.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign and development layouts should also maintain predictability, this predictability is what makes a design usable and pleasing to look at.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EGrids\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on who you are, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.interaction-design.org\u002Fliterature\u002Farticle\u002Fthe-grid-system-building-a-solid-design-layout\"\u003Egrid systems\u003C\u002Fa\u003E are either a blessing or a curse. If we think about them the same as the rule of thirds then we&rsquo;re on the right path. Grids can be used as a definitive approach to layout or be used as an element we purposely break to provide a unique aesthetic approach. Either one is acceptable, it&rsquo;s just up to you and your layout intention.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn music we have a similar principle to grids in instrumental composition. Choosing how to &ldquo;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002FS8fZ62FrquQ\"\u003Earrange\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&rdquo; instruments is vital to the feel of a song. We can choose to have all instruments playing at once,\r\nor start with just one and build it up. Similar to grids, we can use different structural layouts to create the final song, and those different structural layouts dramatically impact the feel of the piece.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EColour theory and white space\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002F99designs.co.uk\u002Fblog\u002Ftips\u002Fthe-7-step-guide-to-understanding-color-theory\u002F\"\u003EColour theory\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, surely there isn&rsquo;t a corollary to anything in music here? Well, not so fast there champ. We can make a comparison here to the idea of\r\nharmony. Colour theory is the idea that selecting colours that are opposites on the colour wheel leads to a pleasing compositional choice as they balance each other out. Why is that? It&rsquo;s because they contain the opposite values, this fills out\r\nthe colour spectrum to its whole.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn music we have a similar thing. Have you ever wondered why the majority of songs contain drums, bass, guitars\u002Fsynths and vocals, for example? It&rsquo;s not by chance, its because these instruments fill the entire audible spectrum humans can perceive.\r\nThere are only so many frequencies that we can hear, by filling space in each of them we can create audible balance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, in both cases, we can play on this idea by breaking these rules at certain moments. Think of the famous &ldquo;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fdj.dancecult.net\u002Findex.php\u002Fdancecult\u002Farticle\u002Fdownload\u002F451\u002F457\"\u003Ebass drop\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&rdquo; in dance music, or dropping to one\r\nguitar before all coming back in, or even moments of complete silence. These are tactics musicians use to create space in the composition and therefore generate the drama and anticipation of when it kicks back in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn design we do this too by using \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fblog.prototypr.io\u002Fimportance-of-white-space-in-design-5a40c0e65bfd\"\u003Ewhite space\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to create a void between the content and colours, creating impact when we drop back in to the palette. We can also do this by dropping to a single colour for a moment and then bringing back the contrast of our secondary opposite colour to fill the visual out.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ERhythm\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can keep all your instruments together following the same rhythm and harmony. This is pleasing to the ear in the fact that it feels together and its easy to nod your head to. Alternatively, you can mix different rhythms or harmony&rsquo;s to produce interesting results. In music we have what&rsquo;s known as a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmathdrumming.com\u002Fpolyrhythms\u002F\"\u003Epolyrhythm\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. This is a rhythmic device where an instrument maintains a rhythm that falls outside of the time signature of the composition\r\nbut, thanks to some maths, falls back into time within a later phrase of the other instruments rhythm.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, in design we can use rhythm and harmony when we think about a layout. When laying out \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.jeroenseynhaeve.com\u002Fpythagoras-and-vertical-rhythm-in-typography\u002F\"\u003Etypography\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, rhythm and harmony are words that often come up. That&rsquo;s\r\nbecause what makes typography often feel pleasing to look at and read is the consistency by which the elements are laid out. If we break this typographic rhythm then it can either have pleasing results (such as for a poster design) or feel unbalanced\r\nand terrible because of a lack of visual consistency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ETime signatures and pacing\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch like rhythm, we can use other mathematical devices to play with our composition. Pacing is key to this, it allows us to think about how fast and slow the entire song should be, but also the speed of each section. Is it full time, is it half time.\r\nPlaying with the pacing is another device we can use to change the feel between sections and drive impact.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you ever listen to music I&rsquo;ve written for Echoes, we play on this idea quite often by leveraging the drama of half time. We love dropping to a final half time ending on a lot of our songs. We do this deliberately because it provides the drama\r\nand release that the build up to the moment expects.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn design we can do this too by building up different layers of composition. By having sections of your design filled with an image, text and buttons, then dropping to a section with just a single centre-aligned paragraph, then an image, and then back\r\ninto a full section with all elements. Doing this creates visual drama and dynamism. It also helps to draw attention to the right things at the right time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEqually, we can play with \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.musicnotes.com\u002Fnow\u002Ftips\u002Fa-complete-guide-to-time-signatures-in-music\u002F\"\u003Etime signatures\u003C\u002Fa\u003E which allow us to create different dynamic rhythms to create more unique feels. Jazz is full of this, but so is a lot of modern metal music.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERap and hip hop use a very common layering of 4\u002F4 backing rhythms and then rapping in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fhellomusictheory.com\u002Flearn\u002Ftriplets\u002F\"\u003Etriplets\u003C\u002Fa\u003E over the top. This is what makes the vocals feel like they&rsquo;re running at a faster pace than the lyrics and feel really fluid. You can count 1, 2, 3 in fast succession over the 4 measures to hear how it works.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn design we can use this idea visually by using contrasting grids on top of each other. Think how it would look to have your type laid out evenly over a 4 block grid but spaced as if it was a 3 block grid. It would create interest by adding additional\r\nwhite space between the words, creating a more intriguing rhythm.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ECombining our principles\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the below example, the navigation bar at the top and the two circular graphics fall on the 4x4 grid whereas the title text sits on a 3x4 grid. Just like triplets fall inside a 4\u002F4 rhythm, different grids can work in harmony to create more interesting\r\nlayouts.

In Figma, a &ldquo;Project&rdquo; is a folder that contains a series of files that you work on. You can have one, several or many. In Code, we use folders (just a regular old computer folder) and inside those folders\r\nwe keep files which contain our code. Like with a Figma project, a folder can contain one, several or many files.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you work in modern Javascript-based frameworks, you&rsquo;ll likely have a whole bunch of files. If you&rsquo;re just keeping it minimal you may only use a single HTML file.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFiles == Files\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell this ones easier right? Each Figma file inside your project is essentially synonymous with the file structure of a development project. You can create multiple files within a project and link them all together with Figma&rsquo;s Shared Libraries feature.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor most development projects, especially those that utilise one of the Javascript frameworks, there will be a bunch of files that all play together nicely (hopefully) to build your site. Figma projects are no different if you take full advantage of the\r\nShared Libraries in Figma (and you should). Decentralising files is a key fundamental in modern development and allows for greater reusability and manageability of your code. Thinking of design files like this too will not only make your files more manageable\r\nbut will also create a wider synergy to your development project when it progresses.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFrames == Divs\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrames in Figma are your canvases. Frames are where you &ldquo;paint&rdquo; the interface of the product or thing you&rsquo;re designing, and in development the notion of &ldquo;painting&rdquo; is true too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESidenote: You may see the phrase &ldquo;Time to first paint&rdquo; if you ever do a Google Lighthouse review of your site, this is Google telling you the time it takes for your site to load the initial interface and allow first interaction. If it&rsquo;s\r\nslow, you&rsquo;ll score low for SEO and with Javascript-based Single Page Apps this can be a problem, so keep an eye on it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like in Figma, Divs act as a container for your code and you can stack as many Divs inside each other as you need (just like Frames). By doing this, you build up a structure for your page. This is where it can start to take life. It&rsquo;s important\r\nto stay focused on building out the core Div structure before getting into the details. Use quick &ldquo;styles&rdquo; on your Divs to create visual separation&mdash;even if it looks garish&mdash;such as `class=&ldquo;border-2 border-black bg-red-500&rdquo;.\r\nI&rsquo;d use primary colours to separate the independent elements and stop you from nitpicking the details.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fkemiljk\u002F67631887f63e7b3b047364ef5df764f4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EThis Gist\u003C\u002Fa\u003E is an example of building up the basic structure of my home page container utilising the TailwindCSS library.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EAuto Layout == Flexbox and Grid\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the above code you&rsquo;ll see some examples of &lsquo;flex&rsquo;, &lsquo;flex-row&rsquo; and &lsquo;grid&rsquo;.

This defines how the object behaves when resized. We can choose between &ldquo;Hug contents&rdquo;&mdash;where the frame itself (i.e. the Div) is perfectly connected to the width of the objects inside and maintains\r\nthe padding and wrapping&mdash;or &ldquo;Fixed width&rdquo; where the the frame width never changes regardless of changes to the internal components. The same rules can be applied to the height property.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is how this looks in practice. Hug Contents is above and Fixed Width below.

I know, I know, it&rsquo;s totally boring and it&rsquo;s fine to have &lsquo;Rectangle 33201&rsquo; or &lsquo;Frame 1000010&rsquo; on your projects if the actual designs look cool. I&rsquo;ve done it many\r\ntimes too. But there is a really valid reason to think more carefully about layer naming, implementation in code.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can handover a file that&rsquo;s name logically from a layering perspective (especially if you&rsquo;ve taken all the above steps too) then you&rsquo;ll find your Engineer(s) have a much easier time implementing the code as they can use it as their\r\nfile architecture or map.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGroups should be given a name that characterises the contents. This is what can relate directly to an &lsquo;ID&rsquo; property or a &lsquo;Class&rsquo;. IDs by their very nature must be unique. In real life you can only have a single form of ID from\r\na single source, the same applies to code. You should use an ID once in your code and not again. If you find yourself repeating them then you should swap these to become classes instead.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn ID gives your particular Div or object a unique identifier which determines what makes it different. You could name a Nav Div, for example, \u003Ccode class=\"  language-text\"\u003ENAV\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E as you should only have one implementation of your core Navigation and reuse that component everywhere (more on this later). If that is true, ID it as \u003Ccode class=\"  language-text\"\u003ENAV\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E and apply the relevant classes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice the use of uppercase. Everyone has different practices, but one I think is particularly useful is to use UPPERCASE words to represent IDs and kebab-case for classes. But really you can do what you want. The reason for a difference? Scanability.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EStyles == Classes\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, in Figma, if you find yourself reusing a particular style everywhere then you&rsquo;ve probably decided (at least I hope so) to create a Figma Style from it. Doing this allows you to create local Text Styles, Color Styles and Effect Styles for a\r\ndocument. That way, repetition is more easy to do and consistency is more likely to be had.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn code we do this too, they&rsquo;re known as classes. Depending on whether you&rsquo;re using a CSS library (like \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftailwindcss.com\u002F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ETailwindCSS\u003C\u002Fa\u003E) or not will likely determine your approach to classes. Tailwind uses what are known as &lsquo;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fadamwathan.me\u002Fcss-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns\u002F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EUtility Classes\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&rsquo;, essentially breaking classes up into atomic parts (see: \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fatomicdesign.bradfrost.com\u002F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAtomic Design\u003C\u002Fa\u003E). What this means in practice is, like in my example earlier, there&rsquo;s lots of bitty classes used to\r\nbuild up a base idea.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust look at this button: \u003Ccode class=\"  language-html\"\u003E&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot;class=&quot;flex flex-row w-full justify-center text-center font-medium btn btn-primary rounded-xl px-6 py-3 bg-blue-400 text-white hover:bg-blue-500 focus:outline-none focus:shadow-outline transition duration-500 ease&quot;&gt;Button 1\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&lt;\u002F\u003C\u002Fspan\u003Ebutton\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&gt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat&rsquo;s a big ol&#39; lot of classes to get the button behaving how I want. But equally, it behaves how I want. I&rsquo;ve have complete control in the place I&rsquo;m creating the button, instead of relying on styling in a separate CSS file. And, once you learn the notation style, it actually gets pretty fast to write (see: \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fbrianlovin.com\u002Foverthought\u002Ftailwind-css-first-impressions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EBrian Lovin on migrating to TailwindCSS\u003C\u002Fa\u003E).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next logical step, of course, is to reduce the amount you do this. And you do this, just like in Figma, through making reusable elements called Components.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EComponents == Components\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow on to the final piece of the puzzle. You&rsquo;ve written a bunch of stuff, but you find yourself copying and pasting it all the time. Doesn&rsquo;t it seem silly to do that? Couldn&rsquo;t it be easier?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where component based design and development comes in. Breaking things up into reusable chunks makes it easier to manage a big build and increases consistency. The beauty of Components too, is that you can decide how atomic you want to make them.\r\nAtomic Design (mentioned earlier) is the extreme end of the spectrum, but if you&rsquo;re already using TailwindCSS then you&rsquo;ve already got a bunch of atomic elements to play with.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I dissect my site, I have:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFour core unique pages\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOne subpage (for blog posts)\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFourteen components\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could be much more atomic with my components. If it was a commercial product, I would be, but the reality is that I don&rsquo;t need to be that strict about it. I&rsquo;m building it to my needs, just like I would a personal Figma file. The most important\r\npart of creating a component of anything is thinking about who&rsquo;s going to use it. Think of your website the same way you think of a Figma Design System. If you created icons with their labels as components, do the same, they&rsquo;ll be easier to\r\nswap out in a conditional statement. If you created different card component types, do the same, again you can use conditionals to control data differences.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EConclusion\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you&rsquo;re working with engineers on a project, talk it through with them. Ask them how they&rsquo;re planning to execute at a code level and build your project to match. If they&rsquo;re going atomic, go atomic. It&rsquo;ll feel tough in the beginning\r\nbut the 1:1 match will be worth it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost importantly though, learn to make these connections in your head. If you can map what you think of in design to what the end engineering build case could be, you&rsquo;ll find that the process of documenting design decisions and handing over projects\r\nbecome far easier.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",metafields:[{children:a,type:i,title:b,key:b,id:"hBqWzeLZ4e",value:af},{children:a,type:f,title:g,key:g,id:"w2crnLiuPJ",value:ag},{children:a,type:j,title:d,key:d,id:"6F3f3CAWv4",value:t,options:[{value:p},{value:q},{value:r}],required:c},{children:a,type:k,title:h,key:h,id:"nJysyo8ioO",value:"abcadb20-424f-11eb-b5f1-77009cd6d567-379D08D9-5691-458E-9F06-DD368E10BEFC.png",required:c,url:ah,imgix_url:K}],bucket:l,type_slug:m,created:ai,created_at:ai,modified_at:aj,status:b,locale:a,published_at:aj,modified_by:e,publish_at:a,unpublish_at:a,thumbnail:K,metadata:{published:af,snippet:ag,tag:t,hero:{url:ah,imgix_url:K}}},{_id:"5fd730c3c902d90008213a73",slug:"dont-let-your-role-define-you",title:"Don’t let your role define you",content:"\u003Cp\u003EThis article started off life as an essay on my career.

I&#39;m constantly in disbelief that I&#39;m actually a designer somewhere. I&#39;m still convinced I &quot;shouldn&#39;t be allowed&quot; because I followed an unconventional path.\r\nBut I am a designer, I do that job and I do it well. It&#39;s hard to fight the negative feelings but you have to remember that you were hired for a reason. You didn&#39;t lie to get there (hopefully), so just keep doing what you do. Someone will tell\r\nyou if you&#39;re not up to scratch.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EDon&#39;t be afraid to learn&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one is probably obvious, but seriously, keep learning. I&#39;ve never stopped trying to get to the bottom of things and become better at the core skills I need to deliver my job. But equally, I keep pushing to learn more. Teaching myself SwiftUI\r\nso I can feel closer to engineering&#39;s implementation of our designs, teaching myself Javascript frameworks to be able to build my own personal site and understand the basics of APIs. These are all fundamental to the products we ship, as designers\r\nwe should know how they work too. Speak in the same language as your developers, it&#39;ll save you all so much time and build a stronger team. Trust me.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EBe comfortable with being uncomfortable&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet uncomfortable. Push yourself to that point. Then sit there, in it, for a while. Get used to that feeling, it&#39;ll help massively with that voice that tells you you&#39;re not worthy. The more you get used to feeling uncomfortable, the more you&#39;ll be comfortable with it. Psychologists often use \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.psychologytools.com\u002Fprofessional\u002Ftechniques\u002Fexposure\u002F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eexposure therapy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to help people overcome their fears. Slowly introducing them to the thing that makes them uncomfortable for longer and longer times until they eventually become comfortable. Do that to yourself. Offer to do a Lunch and Learn on a topic to the entire team, take on that Webflow project when you&#39;ve never used it before, offer to man the phones for a couple of hours to deal with customers. Whatever makes you uncomfortable, push yourself to try it, you&#39;ll see it&#39;s not that bad and you&#39;ll grow tenfold because of it.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EDon&#39;t give up&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you&#39;ve not had that flip yet and you&#39;re still in a role you feel defines you even though it&#39;s not the &quot;you&quot; you want to be; don&#39;t give up. Seriously. It can feel like it&#39;s never going to happen. Trust me, I&#39;ve been\r\nthere. But if you focus on the earlier steps and commit to that journey, you&#39;ll get there. Seek opportunities in your current business to push into areas you want to be in, even be as bold as to ask your manager if there is any chance. You never\r\nknow, that career flip might be right in front of you, you just need the courage to ask.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",metafields:[{children:a,type:i,title:b,key:b,id:"UhAJa03OH0",value:ak},{children:a,type:f,title:g,key:g,id:"DpQAhPpVM8",value:al},{children:a,type:j,title:d,key:d,id:"rFLAnMA5eS",value:o,options:[{value:p},{value:q},{value:r}],required:c},{children:a,type:k,title:h,key:h,id:am,value:"9b947720-424f-11eb-b5f1-77009cd6d567-A54E03DE-5F42-47A6-BAFE-E8C37C8ABE6A.png",required:c,url:an,imgix_url:L}],bucket:l,type_slug:m,created:ao,created_at:ao,modified_at:ap,status:b,locale:a,published_at:ap,modified_by:e,publish_at:a,unpublish_at:a,thumbnail:L,metadata:{published:ak,snippet:al,tag:o,hero:{url:an,imgix_url:L}}},{_id:"5fd15872cd072b000797b369",slug:"code-as-design",title:"Code as Design",content:"\u003Ch3\u003EHow development can be learned through a design lens (and how I managed it)\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;ve said it before, but I am primarily a designer.

I was a pre-teen during the 90&rsquo;s and I got really into modding my Windows 98 and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.instructables.com\u002FCustom-Windows-UI\u002F\"\u003EXP\u003C\u002Fa\u003E interfaces to feel custom to my interests at the time (and let&rsquo;s not forget those \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwinampheritage.com\u002Fskins\"\u003EWinamp skins\u003C\u002Fa\u003E). So I guess, although I wasn&rsquo;t coding at the time, I was beginning to appreciate the link between how the interface \u003Cem\u003Elooks\u003C\u002Fem\u003E and how it \u003Cem\u003Eworks\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn those days, you could do a minimal amount of work to change the appearance, but because you had to install a bunch of different patches and programs to make it work, it did require a reasonable amount of logic and computational literacy to get it working.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I got older and things developed online, I got a \u003Ca href=\"www.myspace.com\"\u003EMySpace\u003C\u002Fa\u003E account and learnt about the power of HTML and inline styling of CSS. Using &ldquo;View Source&rdquo; I could steal the code other people wrote and modify it to my needs. Again, because I&rsquo;m visual-first, I started with hunting down the mods I liked the look of the most and then modified their code to suit what I liked. Starting with colours, I then worked my way into sizing and, hiding things I didn&rsquo;t like by targeting their \u003Ccode class=\" py-2  language-css\"\u003Eid\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E element and hiding them with \u003Ccode class=\" py-2  language-css\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token property\"\u003Edisplay\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E:\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E none\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter MySpace went down the pan&mdash;before Justin Timberlake resurrected it and made it weird&mdash;and things moved on, I drifted away from code and moved more towards the creative side of things. But over the years I was exposed more and more to code through my jobs. And whilst working at \u003Ca href=\"www.cognite.co\"\u003ECognite\u003C\u002Fa\u003E I was fortunate to meet a good friend, \u003Ca href=\"www.nick-wilkins.com\"\u003ENick Wilkins\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, who helped me (and still does) figure a bunch of things out to make me more comfortable with code. More about that here \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.kejk.tech\u002Fthoughts\u002Fdesigning-in-code\"\u003EDesign as Code\u003C\u002Fa\u003E .\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EBack to code\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then, I&rsquo;ve been pushing myself to learn more and more about how to implement my design ideas in code. I started by pushing myself to write my \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fkejk.vercel.app\"\u003Eoriginal personal website\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in pure HTML and CSS. It was clean and simple, but it did the job and refreshed my knowledge. Looking back at it now, it&rsquo;s not that far off where I am now visually, but it&rsquo;s a much more stripped back approach and a far more manual site to update.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe funny thing is, I didn&rsquo;t design this page first. Contrary to the usual approach, I wanted to leverage something I&rsquo;ve talked about before \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.kejk.tech\u002Fthoughts\u002Fdesigning-in-code\"\u003EDevelopment-based Design\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;m not saying you should go away completely from using design tools (I still heavily use Adobe XD and Figma), but I am saying that understanding how to design in code is a superpower that all digital designers should aim to possess.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy manipulating everything in the browser as I went, I learned even more about the power of code, but it felt like something was missing for me. I wanted to find a way to learn the more reactive programming approaches. There&rsquo;d been all this talk about \u003Ca href=\"www.reactjs.org\"\u003EReact\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and it just seemed like a really good thing for me to push towards. But then I looked at it&hellip;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EThe problem with React and why I picked Vue\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, React just didn&rsquo;t properly click. For developers who understand Javascript it offers really powerful ways to build better, more reactive websites. But as a designer who moved into learning code, it was too hard for me to actually make sense\r\nof. The leap from HTML and CSS to React was massive and it put me off.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvuejs.org\"\u003EVue\u003C\u002Fa\u003E! I stumbled across Vue by accident. I knew I wanted to learn something more reactive so I started searching around, found Vue and it just clicked instantly. I dropped the CDN script into a prototype project I was working on at \u003Ca href=\"www.neuerenergy.com\"\u003ENeuerEnergy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and I was away. I could write the HTML and CSS I knew, and then inject some Javascript in&mdash;when I wanted to and had learned to&mdash;to power up the site with clever reactivity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then my love of Vue began and I decided the best way to learn it better was to rebuild my personal website in Vue. So welcome \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fkejk.kejk.now.sh\"\u003EKEJK v2\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. I decided that because we&rsquo;d been leveraging the power of Material Design at NeuerEnergy, I wanted to do the same for my personal website (avoiding too much brain overload) and thus found the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvuetifyjs.com\u002Fen\u002F\"\u003EVuetify library\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to help me on my journey. This meant I could build in the same way I could design, using a design framework that already made sense to me. If I wanted a card, Vuetify had a \u003Ccode class=\" py-2  language-html\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&lt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003Ev-card\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&gt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E to offer me, if I wanted to break into a grid, I had \u003Ccode class=\" py-2  language-html\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&lt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003Ev-row\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&gt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E and \u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&lt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003Ev-col\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&gt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fcode\u003Eto\r\nhelp me out. It all just made sense.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EVue, Nuxt, Cosmic, Drafts and TailwindCSS\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI loved that personal site, it also provided me with a lot of interest from prospective employers when applying for other design roles. Being able to tell them that I&rsquo;d built the website myself and used Vue to do so gave me a level of skill that other designers weren&rsquo;t always able to offer. This doesn&rsquo;t mean I was \u003Cem\u003Ebetter\u003C\u002Fem\u003E in any way, I just offered \u003Cem\u003Edifferent\u003C\u002Fem\u003E skills and sometimes those skills are super helpful for the right design team.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found that exact design team. In my current role at \u003Ca href=\"www.homehero.co.uk\"\u003EHomeHero\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, I was hired specifically because I could span the breadth of design and development. Connecting Design and Engineering teams is often an overwhelming and complex task. More often than not, projects aren&rsquo;t handed over properly and a lot of important information is either lost in translation or just straight up missed. Usually, this isn&rsquo;t the fault of anyone particularly, better processes could help (I&rsquo;ll be writing about this at some point soon) but also understanding the language of development and being able to understand \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhat it takes\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E to deliver on your grand &ldquo;cross-device isometric animated timeline&rdquo; can have a massive, lasting impact on the connectedness of your team and the quality of the outcome. Moreover, I&rsquo;m able to work directly with the Engineering team to style the frontend of some of our projects, lifting a weight off of them and giving Design the power to own the interface from idea to execution.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what was next for me? Well, as you can see there were two iterations of my previous site but you&rsquo;re reading this on the third. I realised that I had an opportunity to improve things. I wanted to make my content more reactive and allow myself more opportunities to utilise a headless CMS to power a lot of the content that could change regularly. This is when I came across \u003Ca href=\"www.cosmicjs.com\"\u003ECosmicJS\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Cosmic is a super flexible, \u003Cstrong\u003Ereally well documented\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E headless CMS (with an unbelievably generous free tier). Cosmic has allowed me to power pages such as my \u003Ca href=\"www.kejk.tech\u002Fthoughts\"\u003EThoughts\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (where you&rsquo;re reading this) and \u003Ca href=\"www.kejk.tech\u002Fuses\"\u003EUses\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Now I can update content via Cosmic&rsquo;s\r\nsimple backend, avoiding any need to dive into the code to create a new blog post or update my gear.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, I&rsquo;m writing this on \u003Ca href=\"www.getdrafts.com\"\u003EDrafts\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for iPad and will be posting it to my Cosmic bucket using a custom \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Factions.getdrafts.com\u002Fa\u002F1fP\"\u003EPOST action\u003C\u002Fa\u003E I wrote. This makes things frictionless for me now.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;ve also refactored the site to use \u003Ca href=\"www.nuxtjs.org\"\u003ENuxt.js\u003C\u002Fa\u003E so I can take better advantage of dynamic page routing, SEO meta info and their module system. I even went as far as to ditch my use of Material Design and refactored all of the HTML to use \u003Ca href=\"www.tailwindcss.com\"\u003ETailwindCSS\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. This means I&rsquo;m looking up docs less and focusing on writing code in a way my brain already thinks&hellip; in CSS.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ESo what&rsquo;s the future?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;m not really sure where I go next with things. I can probably better implement Cosmic into my site, making more content dynamic. I also want to write some more Drafts actions to try and make things like updating a post more straightforward. But\r\nother than that, I&rsquo;m feeling really excited about where things are and what I&rsquo;ve managed to teach myself.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;ve said it before several times, but I urge you if you&rsquo;re a designer who&rsquo;s working with developers; learn the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, try out a framework like Vue + Nuxt (give SwiftUI a try too). They&rsquo;re all becoming\r\nso much more accessible to people without programming knowledge already (or a more visually-focused brain like me) and I promise it&rsquo;ll be worth it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can do it, so can you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",metafields:[{children:a,type:i,title:b,key:b,id:"xoUX1jwYqw",value:aq},{children:a,type:f,title:g,key:g,id:"GZSFx5HxCs",value:ar},{children:a,type:j,title:d,key:d,id:"Vllh3r4OFL",value:s,options:[{value:p},{value:q},{value:r}],required:c},{children:a,type:k,title:h,key:h,id:am,value:"867164c0-424f-11eb-b5f1-77009cd6d567-D26ABC80-B065-4EE3-9B8E-226A5816A182.png",required:c,url:as,imgix_url:M}],bucket:l,type_slug:m,created:at,created_at:at,modified_at:au,status:b,locale:a,modified_by:e,publish_at:a,unpublish_at:a,published_at:au,thumbnail:M,metadata:{published:aq,snippet:ar,tag:s,hero:{url:as,imgix_url:M}}},{_id:"5fcab80c1a5bdc00070d2962",slug:"designing-in-the-open",title:"Designing in the open",content:"\u003Ch3\u003EWhat I&rsquo;ve learnt about sharing constantly and live designing with my team\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesigners are precious people. Arguably, the vast majority of Creatives are precious people.

The very nature of having two individuals meant that we were somewhat forced into working in the open. We, in most cases, would be working across the same files because of the needs of the organisation\r\nat the time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing we did though, was use Figma. By default, Figma&rsquo;s goal is to enable and encourage working out in the open. Whether that&rsquo;s through the cross-platform, web-based tool&rsquo;s easy sharing options, or the multi-cursor features, it became\r\nsuper easy for us to bring product managers and developers into the fold too.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we&rsquo;ve grown, we&rsquo;ve ensured that we maintain this approach to working. Although we only open access to our files once they&rsquo;re in the right shape, we actively seek product manager and developer input during the early stages of design.\r\nAllowing them in to the fold when the file is still a mess of ideas and mistakes ensures that we don&rsquo;t spend too long going down the wrong path or thinking we&rsquo;ve understood the brief but we&rsquo;ve actually got it hugely wrong.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EBeing consistent\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all well and good, but it&rsquo;s easy to lose consistency with this and retreat back to the WIP-obsessed designer mindset.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe&rsquo;ve done it as a team. We started with really open access in Figma. Anyone with a HomeHero email address could just jump in to any file and have a nose around and have their say. We experienced a few moments where we got some unhelpful feedback\r\non parts of a project that were just experiments. And the problem is, no matter what the page was labelled or what text is included on the page, it&rsquo;s not always clear to an outsider that something is an experiment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt&rsquo;s not an issue just for us as designers. Receiving unnecessary feedback isn&rsquo;t helpful, and it&rsquo;s also a huge waste of time for the person who spent their precious hours adding comments to something that was a passing idea anyway.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFinding a happy medium\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to maintain our openness across the organisation, whilst also ensuring we don&rsquo;t fall into the old traps, we&rsquo;ve spent some time crafting a way forwards.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch4\u003EOur default position is that only Design have Figma access to our Team now.\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that only the design team have open access across all the Figma documents we&rsquo;ve created.

What are the things that they say to hook potential or existing customers? And why does this matter?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, let&rsquo;s start with a story. Early on in my career, I was a sales person. I left University with a Masters in Fine Art but didn&rsquo;t feel I was worthy of a design or development role (despite developing skills in both places for around 10\r\nyears prior) so I went from my full-time retail job at Apple to working as an Account Executive in pharmaceutical advertising. My job was to keep projects on track, win new business and keep clients happy. I was solely responsible for selling the vision\r\nof our design and development teams and ensure coordination and clarification across the board.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it came to meetings, I had to work hard to explain how something had been done, why it would take 2 months to build &ldquo;that&rdquo; feature and why they couldn&rsquo;t have the &ldquo;other&rdquo; feature they wanted. Throughout that process,\r\nI learnt the intricacies and nuances of behaviour, of the complexity of communicating something widely understood by designers and developers, but deeply misunderstood by customers. I expanded skills learnt from Apple Retail about how to explain the complex\r\nin a simple way, breaking technology down to its simplest form and developing similes and metaphors for different approaches. All of this led to accurate communication and valuable insight into the customer experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, fast forward to now. Now I design and develop the frontend experience of products. From initial idea through to final execution. Throughout this process, I have regular touch points with our sales team to ensure that each feature is developed deeply\r\ninline with the requirements of our target market and explain why we&rsquo;ve designed it one way, or developed it another. Why it can&rsquo;t be exactly like that thing they showed me that one time that kind of did the same thing. Why it&rsquo;s going\r\nto take six months to develop that special graph that takes data from 56 sources, runs a machine learning algorithm to extract the most valuable insights, feeds it back into the UI and generates a personalised graph in real-time with up-to-the-second\r\ndata.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I also go to those meetings, sit in on those calls, talk to those potential customers and explain these things myself. Explain our UI decisions in detail. Spend hours in workshops justifying decisions and ensuring our customers see why. And in these\r\nworkshops, our sales team learn. They learn how we think about design and development decisions, why we push back when we do, and how to communicate this to customers. They learn to not promise the earth and that it&rsquo;ll be delivered in 2 weeks. They\r\nlearn to speak in a language that is both technical and customer-centric.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens, is both sides learn how to communicate better. With each other, with the customer, with their peers. Designers and developers learn how to sell. Sales people learn how to communicate technological ideas and not over promise.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone wins.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, by tightly coupling sales with the technology teams, the result is a wonderful world where all parties are working to the same goal and with the same attitudes, understanding and beliefs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E team must be \u003Cstrong\u003Eone\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E team.

Really, it was birthed in Silicon Valley as a way of thinking about the end person using your product and avoid a narrow focus on delivering a solution that you (as in the company) think is the\r\nright thing. The problem with a user focus is that it&rsquo;s easy to abstract the term user into being a statistic. A user is a term we attribute onto a person that uses our product, but it is far too easy for that to become a percentage on a spreadsheet\r\nor a cumulative number that appears on an analytics report. Treating the people we affect most as users can have a negative effect on how we think about our products and lead us to believe that our focus is on increasing that percentage or building up\r\nthose numbers, only.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch4\u003EWhy we should be Human-centred\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuman-centered design is a term that&#39;s been explored and advocated for by many established designers from David and Tom Kelley, to Donald Norman and even into architecture by way of Mike Cooley.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy argument is for a permanant change, a move away from user-centricity and user experience and towards human-centricity and human-experience. By doing this, we can&rsquo;t abstract away who we are affecting. Those directly effected are other humans and\r\nas such, it helps focus the mind on doing our best work and allows to think more wholly about what we&rsquo;re creating.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENumbers are important, we need to keep an eye on those analytics reports and the statistics from audience feedback, but that needn&rsquo;t draw away from the very humans that we are affecting. Sometimes, decisions that may seem bad statistically, are\r\nactually right ethically. Making decisions that directly impact on the humans using your product are often some of the hardest and most important. Losing sight of those real people that you&rsquo;re affecting with every slight change of pixels on a UI,\r\nremoval of &lsquo;old&rsquo; functionality or choice of distribution platform, can have lasting effects on their respect for your company and the values you represent.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo think carefully about every decision you make as a brand and contemplate the impact on the humans you&rsquo;re working for, because no matter what you believe, the other humans of this earth are the people you&rsquo;re helping and those humans need\r\nyou to care about them first.
