It was always a pretty lonely experience but also empowering because I was the sole design decision maker, or, I only had to convince one other designer of why\r\nwe should take a certain direction.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the flip side, I ended up missing out on a large chunk of design education. I never had the benefit of learning from my peers or gaining lots of great feedback through structured critiques.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhat arrogantly in the beginning, I told myself that I didn&rsquo;t need that. Not that I knew enough about designing but that I could figure it out on my own. That being part of a bigger team would dilute my influence and I&rsquo;d be worse off in\r\nmy career.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe truth is, being part of a larger design team that offers a structured critique process is actually one of the best things you can experience. But only if your team defines a process.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ENever forget Context\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I first joined \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.moneyboxapp.com\"\u003EMoneybox\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, we were already actively doing design crits on a Friday afternoon. They were a relatively informal affair and we&rsquo;d show up, say if we wanted to show some work, then jump into\r\nan Overflow file or Sketch file and just zoom around the canvas sharing some relatively unfiltered and unstructured thoughts about our design and open it up to the room to comment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem was, there was little to no context. As a growing company, we&rsquo;re split into separate workstreams which we call missions. This allows us to separate our individual strengths and deliver across the different areas of the business. As a\r\ndesign team, we&rsquo;re no different. We split against these missions too and whilst this makes it a lot easier to focus our individual energy on a specific and consistent area of the business (such as Payments or Retirement), it also means our knowledge\r\nof the wider design changes is fragmented.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, context is really important when we share our work with each other. Without proper context, we lose any hope of offering great feedback. However, it&rsquo;s very possible to over or under contextualise, and finding the balance can be extremely tough.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch4\u003ESo how do you create good context?\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, utilising slides is a powerful approach. Much like presenting your portfolio to get a job or sharing a monthly update with the wider business, slides offer a set of constraints that ensure you don&rsquo;t share too much at a time. They act as\r\na container for your explanation and ensure that you must only show the highest clarity visual explanation of your solution.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also offers a way to create a proper sense of storytelling and setting yourself up for success comes from setting up a great story.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch4\u003EUsing a design process to build your story\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003EStart with \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhat\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E you&rsquo;re going to share\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESet the \u003Cstrong\u003Ebusiness context\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E \u002F business problem\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDefine your \u003Cstrong\u003Ecustomer problem statement\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E (if applicable)\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EShare any \u003Cstrong\u003Ehypotheses\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E you have\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EShow a \u003Cstrong\u003Ecouple of experiments\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E but never more than three\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EShowcase the solution you&rsquo;re \u003Cstrong\u003Emost convinced\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E solves these problems\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAsk for \u003Cstrong\u003Especific\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E feedback on your designs\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere&rsquo;s plenty of other approaches to storytelling and lots of great articles on what you can do, but this is the approach I always aim to take.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may ask &ldquo;what if my work is still really early stage?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a problem statement&rdquo;. Well, you&rsquo;re in luck, this process still works.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you&rsquo;re in the early stages, the only difference should be the fidelity of the work. You can also show three experiments and ask for your team&rsquo;s thoughts on which direction to dig deeper into.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you&rsquo;re more focused on the earlier stages and don&rsquo;t have a problem statement. Front load a bit more heavily on the context and ask for support in getting to a great problem statement. But, remember that a crit session is aimed at providing\r\nfeedback, not solving problems. So be careful of converting it into a workshop. Always ensure you have a starting point which you&rsquo;re asking for feedback on, rather than asking your team to help craft it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EA critique is not a workshop or ideation session\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;ve seen crits turn into sessions where a designer is essentially trying to solve their problem by getting lots of design heads together. This is important, but it&rsquo;s not the goal of a crit. A crit is intended to receive \u003Cstrong\u003Efeedback&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003Eon an approach, idea, solution, not to get the \u003Cstrong\u003Eanswers\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E to your problem.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a designer, it&rsquo;s your responsibility to bring your ideas to the table and create enough context to get meaningful feedback. Going into a crit expecting your team to solve your problems is like going to a bar and expecting the barman to drink\r\nyour drink for you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few failed sessions, it became clear to me that slides were necessary. But rather than enforcing that approach on the team we chose to take a &ldquo;learn by observing&rdquo; approach.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went into my next critique armed with a well considered deck that followed the earlier process.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI shared my work, got excellent and actionable feedback, went away and updated my designs and presented them back the following week to high fives all around. The process worked, and worked well. But what I also noticed was that most other designs on\r\nthe team came to the next session armed with excellent presentations and the process continued.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EA critique is not criticism\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething I struggled with earlier in my career was receiving feedback. Feedback often felt like a criticism of my work, of me.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt&rsquo;s very common in the earlier stages of your career to feel emotionally attached to your work. To think of the design as a little piece of you. But the truth is, it&rsquo;s just an artefact. A fragment of an idea that you&rsquo;ve been the one\r\nto extract.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took me several years to learn to detach &ldquo;me&rdquo; from the work. Whether that&rsquo;s my \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.verywellmind.com\u002Fwhat-is-the-id-2795275\"\u003Eid\u003C\u002Fa\u003E complex expecting instant gratification for the work I&rsquo;ve put in to everything or just because of the time it took to create, it&rsquo;s been hard.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut detachment is key to getting great results. A critique shouldn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s harmful or personal. It shouldn&rsquo;t feel like an attack. If it does, there&rsquo;s two things wrong:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYour critique isn&rsquo;t structured well for feedback and the context isn&rsquo;t clear enough\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou&rsquo;ve not been able to disconnect yourself from the work\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENumber 2 is harder to solve, that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ll need to take time to work through. But number 1 is the point of this article.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrough a great design process and through structured communication, you can ensure that crits don&rsquo;t fall to criticism. If you feel personally attacked, it is likely unintentional but it&rsquo;s worth discussing with the other designer(s) afterwards\r\nto resolve the personal conflict.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other approach is to be very clear about what you&rsquo;re \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E looking for feedback on. That&rsquo;ll help structure your feedback and help the rest of the team narrow in on what you need.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for feedback on the execution of this new call to action style. What I&rsquo;m not looking for is feedback on the illustration or customer journey as I&rsquo;m not able to change this within the project scope&rdquo;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing upfront and clear avoids any confusion or misinterpretation. And if someone feeds back on one of those things, politely explain that it wasn&rsquo;t in scope for this session and move the conversation on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EContinuing a great process\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we onboard new designers to the team, again, we don&rsquo;t explicitly mention that we should follow this process anymore. It&rsquo;s not that we can&rsquo;t, but we just don&rsquo;t need to. By default our team shares in this way and new designers\r\nlearn by observing when they join.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my team mates built a fantastic presentation library in Figma that we leverage for crafting our crit presentations. These have become so admired that our wider business want them for their use too&hellip;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery week now, I look forward to our crit sessions and see them as a valuable opportunity to offer my recommendations or to ask lots of questions. It&rsquo;s a safe place for designers to push each other out of our comfort zones or challenge and approach\r\nwithout it having to feel critical or unreasonable.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur crits are completely invaluable to our process and our \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002F_kejk\u002Fstatus\u002F1492098919530172425?s=21\"\u003Esuccess\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ESquaring the circle\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately to bring it back to my origins. I thought that joining a bigger team would lead me to have less influence but it goes to show that no matter how small of a change you encourage, it can have a wildly large impact.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully you&rsquo;ve learnt a bit about &ldquo;how to make friends and influence designers.&rdquo; \u003Ca href=\"mailto:karl@kejk.tech?subject=Crit%20process\"\u003EShoot me a message\u003C\u002Fa\u003E if you&rsquo;ve experienced anything similar and let me know if you disagree with anything I&rsquo;ve shared.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",metadata:{hero:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.cosmicjs.com\u002Faeb86150-8bea-11ec-ae88-8982447d5ddf-How-to-make-friends-and-influence-designers2x.png",imgix_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimgix.cosmicjs.com\u002Faeb86150-8bea-11ec-ae88-8982447d5ddf-How-to-make-friends-and-influence-designers2x.png"},published:"2022-02-12",snippet:"Why every design crit should be presented on slides",tag:"design"},modified_at:"2022-02-17T21:58:39.652Z",order:null,__typename:"Object"}}],fetch:[],mutations:[]});
