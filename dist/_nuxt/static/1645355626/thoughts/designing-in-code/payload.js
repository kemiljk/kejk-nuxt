Thanks to the beauty of &#39;View Source&#39;, it was possible to see the detail of what another person had done, pull that\r\ncode, and tweak to your heart&#39;s content until you broke it again.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter MySpace died and I moved on to other, less emo, things I found myself falling away from programming. That was until I started a job in healthcare leading the digital design and development of projects. This all came about organically but I was kinda\r\nout of my depth.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily, I had a great relationship with the core developer on our team and over time started to tinker again, this time though, in production code (mostly because I did the crappy little jobs that he liked not having to do).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I started to learn, was the magic of development-based design, or frontend design, where I would manipulate the UI (or DOM) inside the browser itself to see how I preferred things. It felt like the old days of tinkering on MySpace again.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more I did it, the more I enjoyed the experience of designing in the browser. I&#39;m not saying you should go away completely from using design tools (I still heavily use \u003Ca class=\"text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-300 font-medium\" href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fadobe.com\u002Fxd\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAdobe XD\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and \u003Ca class=\"text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-300 font-medium\" href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffigma.com\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EFigma\u003C\u002Fa\u003E), but I am saying that understanding how to design in code is a superpower that all digital designers should\r\naim to possess.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the key reasons why:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Col class=\"list-decimal ml-8\"\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou can see the direct effect of a decision, in the browser, in real-time\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou can learn the language of development, allowing for better cross-communication between you and your development team\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou can increase your output at your company, enabling developers to focus on the logic and complexities whilst you manipulate the styling in production code\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou can improve your ability to work independently on client projects as a freelancer\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of the Frontend Designer \u003Ca class=\"text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-300 font-medium\" href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fbradfrost.com\u002Fblog\u002Fpost\u002Ffrontend-design\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eisn&#39;t new\u003C\u002Fa\u003E but it certainly isn&#39;t widespread either.
