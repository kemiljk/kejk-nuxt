My first two weeks are being spent alongside the wider CS team, learning about our customers&#39; pain points first-hand, as well as those moments of delight&mdash;such as someone being able to buy their first home thanks to our LISA&mdash;and providing them with world class customer service.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the first time as a designer that I&rsquo;ve not been designing something from day one, and honestly, it&rsquo;s the best feeling. Whilst I&rsquo;m itching to get started on my first design project, easing into a company who&rsquo;s product I&rsquo;ve used as a customer for the past 4 years by experiencing the CS role has been one of the most enjoyable onboarding experiences I&rsquo;ve had.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I&rsquo;ve seen a trend; \u003Cem\u003Ethings that come up via CS enquiries turn into new product features.

Obviously this can&rsquo;t be true for everything we hear, including many customer feature requests, but for anything that is a clear customer issue that appears regularly, this is 100% the case. And this tells me something important; at Moneybox we care about our customer experience and it is embodied throughout the business.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe common requests that come up often (I can&rsquo;t talk specifics right now due to them being unreleased features) aren&rsquo;t things that we can&rsquo;t resolve already. Two of our new features are really straightforward to handle from our CS admin. But the truth of the matter is, a customer should \u003Cem\u003Ejust be able to do it themselves\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing. We&rsquo;re shipping features to make that true. And that embodies for me a culture of customer care and one of shipping necessary features often. It shows a connectedness across the business, from CS to Ops, Design to Development, Insight to Marketing. All of these departments are interconnected, and, woven throughout all of this is a desire to do the best for our customers. That&rsquo;s a place I want to be.

It&rsquo;s also relentless. Take a moment to be grateful for your CS team and maybe have a coffee chat with one of them next week. Thank them for their efforts.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENot doing your day job from day one is a really great way to start a new role.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E For all you managers out there, not trying to get a new employee to hit the ground running from day one is actually a really good thing. It&rsquo;ll help you to get the most out of them when they do actually start their role officially, and it&rsquo;ll help them to appreciate more of the wider business. Whilst intros to different departments are useful, they&rsquo;re a far cry from actually having to do the job for a bit.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESecondments can be really valuable.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Ask your employer for secondments into other areas of the business, even if just for a day, if you feel it&rsquo;ll enhance your role to do so. As a designer, spending time with CS, marketing\u002Finsights or development could have a significant positive impact on your day-to-day and allow you to see opportunities to improve your processes or push for a specific feature to be promoted in importance.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuild a culture of connectedness.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E By encouraging departmental secondments, you ensure that you build a wider respect for different departments and connect your teams through action. A sales colleague may gain great value from spending time with marketing to understand how the product is sold direct to the consumer; a marketing colleague may find value in joining data science for a short time to gather insight about how they think about data; a data scientist may benefit from spending time with insight to see the true impact of the latest feature shipped. Not all secondments are created equal, but there&rsquo;s so much value that can be gained from time spent in another department.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll have plenty more to say, but for now, these are my immediate raw thoughts on the process of being a CS for my first week.

These lessons are not necessarily about Covid, they&rsquo;re about other factors that have impacted on my life too such as losing my father and from what my latest startup adventure has taught me.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are my observations, maybe you&rsquo;ll be able to learn something from these too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E1. That deeply understanding what you&rsquo;re designing for by learning to build your idea is incredibly valuable\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might feel obvious with a cursory glance, but it&rsquo;s true. Lots of people say it, and lots of people have varying opinions on what &lsquo;learning to build your idea&rsquo; truly is. In my mind, it&rsquo;s whatever it takes to realise your vision enough to make sense of it as a true end product, even if that&rsquo;s incredibly MVP.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took this approach by building out Figma plugins to scratch an itch around weird interface quirks or missing features. I could have not bothered, or I could have asked someone else to build it, or even find the nearest alternative. But the reality is, I spent the time to learn to create them myself, in turn, I better understood how Figma works under the hood, and finally learned lots of valuable TypeScript along the way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt taught me a lot about shipping products to customers, whether it&rsquo;s free or not, it matters.

The value of building and having a robust design system is not to be ignored\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign systems are complicated, they&rsquo;re time consuming to build well and there&rsquo;s still an enormous gap between the designed design system (in Figma, Sketch or another tool of choice) versus the coded component library (the name difference alone is irritating!).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, taking the time to build out a robust system makes the world of difference in the long run. If you take the time to create flexible components, and think about their relationship to each other and their scalability, you&rsquo;ll start to reap the rewards pretty fast. If you can keep lesson 1 in mind too and actually try to create any of these in Vue, React, Swift or similar, then you&rsquo;ll also find limitations that allow you to rethink how you designed it in the first place. So you can go back and improve on its flexibility and scalability.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERobust systems also ensure consistency of your brand application across interfaces and other media. I saw a lot of worry previously about design systems being so good that a developer can build content without a design. Great! That should be the goal. If they can build views without Design mocking them up, Design can focus on defining the intention of the work, it&rsquo;s reason for being, the customer value, the stakeholder needs etc. Designing the intention, not designing the mock.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPithy takeaway: Design systems create room for more intentional work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E3. The importance of building strong design&mdash;dev relationships\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning how components are built, giving it a go yourself, that&rsquo;s all useful in ensuring a positive handover experience with Development\u002FEngineering. But if they&rsquo;re not onboard with the design strategy and don&rsquo;t buy in to the use case of components then you&rsquo;re never going to build the best bond for the best end product.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesigners and Developers should be like Ham and Cheese, no matter what they go together. You should be in each other&rsquo;s pockets in a positive way, defining and scoping solutions from the outset, together. If you show willing by trying to prototype a component in real code or just showing that you&rsquo;ve considered limitations though good documentation, it&rsquo;ll go a long way. A great engineer will take the time to explain other limitations you may have missed and together you&rsquo;ll build something truly scalable and great.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPithy takeaway: Start building that relationship as early as you can.

That business needs and product needs are often at odds with each other but that&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s all about compromise\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBusinesses have needs that can often vary from what the product really requires, for example, when fundraising a business will be focused on optics and future product vision, whereas during a period after fundraising, they&rsquo;ll likely focus more on growth.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt&rsquo;s common for these business needs to clash with product needs. Often VCs will turn down businesses by not ever saying no, and instead, by offering product feedback so they keep an open door in case you suddenly do find the traction they desire. When they do this, it&rsquo;s easy for stakeholders outside of the Product team to prioritise these seemingly &ldquo;important&rdquo; features. The reality is, these features are merely an easy out for the investor and will often lead to feature bloat in your product.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt&rsquo;s a tough line to walk, trying to appease VCs or business stakeholders is important, but it can be super hard to do this without straying from your product roadmap.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPithy takeaway: Compromise is key, but don&rsquo;t let business requirements derail your product roadmap.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E5. That startups are hard, but a strong team and a true bond is enough to get you through it\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever underestimate the power of building strong relationships. Working at startups, or any company for that matter, is incredibly difficult. But in reality, it&rsquo;s just business and businesses have their ups and downs. What gets you through is having strong relationships. Focus on building them and harnessing them to air out your concerns and worries along the way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving great friends outside of work is awesome, but they don&rsquo;t know what the day to day feels like. Having great colleagues internally, makes all of the difference. They understand the nuances of the businesses and are often times going through what you are. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to be vulnerable but avoid falling into hearsay and negativity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPithy takeaway: Great relationships at work will see you through the toughest times.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E6. That product managers are essential, if you give them the freedom to do their best work!\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good Product Manager (PM) is like a good red wine; let them breathe for a little while and they&rsquo;ll only get better. I&rsquo;ve seen situations where Product Managers are essentially just task managers, writing Jira tickets and little more. This isn&rsquo;t good product management or good use of a Product Manager. They should write Jira tickets for definite, but not just that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good PM is given the freedom to do what they need to do at any time. To drive the team forwards and push for the best outcome for both the business and product team too. A good PM also works closely with design at the outset, working through user experience documentation and process; helping to define the pain points and intended happy paths, being part of the user research process, supporting the design documentation process and ensuring that there&rsquo;s a solid brief.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn some ways, in the outset of the design process, it should be hard to know which person is the designer and which is the PM, only when it comes to pursuing wireframes and detailed design processes should that split occur.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPithy takeaway: Product Managers are essential, but give them room to do their job!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E7. That design, development and the intersection of the two are my lifeblood\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a personal one, but maybe one that is good to share. I&rsquo;ve learnt that caring about both design and development, understanding both of those processes and being confident in both are what excites me and keeps me motivated. Knowing that, writing it down and owning it, helps me to stay on course with my passions and guides my life choices accordingly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPithy takeaway: Find your perfect fit. Lean into it. And never let it go.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E8. To never underestimate the power of taking chances\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike a Monopoly &lsquo;Chance&rsquo; card, taking a chance can be a risk that either has a reward or a negative consequence. Either way, every chance you take is a lesson learnt and in many ways is a chance to grow and evolve. Chances can either validate your decision making and improve your life or invalidate your decision making, change things and cause you to course correct. No matter which it is, you learn a lot by taking them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot all chances are created equal though. Gambling is chance (unless you&rsquo;ve got some mad skills) and is more often than not, likely to end badly. Changing careers is a chance that can equally either pay off or lead to a need to flip again. But whatever happens, own the chances you take and look at them from a longer-term perspective. You might find that what once felt like the worst thing that could ever happen, actually ended up changing your life for the better.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPithy takeaway: Over the long term, chances are what teach you the most.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E9.

It&rsquo;s been a very tough couple of months but practicing elements of buddhist and stoic ideologies has helped me to work through it all. Equally, channelling my inner &ldquo;Dad&rdquo; has helped a lot too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Dad was a true stoic, minimalist and intentional human. He believed in living in the present moment always and through his diagnosis and 6 and a half years of dealing with it, he never once complained or let it hold him back. Instead he made the most of every single moment he had on this planet. He explored parts of the country he&rsquo;d never seen before, spent time with the people he loved most, focused on restoring a forest nearby to where he lived and gave back to the planet more than he ever had before.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;m now focused on channelling him as much as I can to live my life with the most intention.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPithy takeaway: Live every moment with intention, but not like it&rsquo;s your last.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E10.

This is a term that was often super unclear in my early days as I confused it with the role of an Industrial Designer. In reality, whether the product is digital\r\nor physical, designing a product makes you, technically, a product designer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe&rsquo;ve continued to expand the spectrum of what a Product Designer is and what their craft should be; from apps to websites, and virtual reality to audio-only, from physical products to the intangible. Product Design is the art of building something\r\nfrom nothing, but I&rsquo;m seeing a shift in what that role should encompass, and I think we&rsquo;re going to have to hone our craft to include a new skill: Spatial Design.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether it be visual space or auditory space, being able to design for different spatial planes will be critical to the success of the next breed of designers as AR, VR, MR and audio-only platforms take off as the mediums of the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the announcement of \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.apple.com\u002Fuk\u002Fairtag\u002F\"\u003EApple&rsquo;s AirTag\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, playing with the delightful experience of finding a lost tag got me thinking carefully about what this design experience really was. The experience included\r\na physical product, a visual experience (including physics-rendered objects), a sense of spatial plane (vertical and horizontal direction), haptic feedback, and an auditory experience. That&rsquo;s a lot of things to cram into a single, small, $29 product.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key to the success of the AirTag experience is in the team&rsquo;s sense of spatial planes when designing for it.

I&rsquo;m a designer by trade but I tend to get my feet wet in the development side too. If you&rsquo;ve read my posts previously or even looked on my site, you&rsquo;ll notice the distinct 50\u002F50ish split of design and development\r\nprojects and\u002For posts. Being in control of the majority of the stack when it comes to projects I work on has proven super useful in terms of creative control and individual learning. But one thing I&rsquo;ve always found too abstract and difficult to\r\nlearn is backend development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrontend dev and design go hand in hand. I&rsquo;ve spoken vocally before about my belief that Designers should understand \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.kejk.tech\u002Fthoughts\u002Fcode-as-design\"\u003Ehow their work is built\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and should ideally be \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002F_kejk\u002Fstatus\u002F1380866907377647618?s=21\"\u003Ecomfortable\u003C\u002Fa\u003E experimenting in that world themselves too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackend has always felt more complex to me, and APIs were a terrifying concept, so I went on the hunt for a headless CMS option to power my website and get my start in implementing API-driven updates to my website. I was looking through a host of different\r\noptions but specifically trying to get a good free tier that would enable me to power my website fully without having to pay until I was sure it was the right thing for me. This site makes me &pound;0, so keeping it as free as possible to run is ideal\r\n(coincidentally this site only costs me about &pound;6 a month to run if you divide up the domain cost per year).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring my hunting I came across \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cosmicjs.com\"\u003ECosmic\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and saw that it had a super generous free tier, one that could end up being viable for long-term use. Cosmic is a headless CMS that decouples your content from your frontend. By doing this, it meant I could create content &lsquo;buckets&rsquo; (to use Cosmic&rsquo;s nomenclature) to separate my content into different places and power different projects from it (more on why this is great later!).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow I&rsquo;ve written five pieces of value a headless CMS can bring to your project or projects.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E1. Decouple your architecture\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy decoupling your backend from your frontend you can live in a world of a &ldquo;separation of concerns&rdquo;. This is important. By separating your content from your UI, you avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. I use \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nuxtjs.org\"\u003ENuxt\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to build this website, so I could have used the \u003Ccode\u003Econtent\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E module to write markdown and post into my site. That leaves me reliant on Nuxt or another markdown-driven module, it couples me to the architecture. But by using Cosmic, I&rsquo;m able to write my markdown (like this post for example) in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.getdrafts.com\"\u003EDrafts\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and then \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cosmicjs.com\u002Farticles\u002Fhow-to-post-to-a-cosmic-bucket-directly-from-the-drafts-app-d939e480-3bc8-11eb-a739-b574ca5054de\"\u003Ewrite a little script\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to publish straight to my Cosmic bucket (and which now also runs a webhook in Vercel to republish my site and posts a draft into my \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.buttondown.email\"\u003EButtondown\u003C\u002Fa\u003E backend to create a new subscriber post). Now I&rsquo;m not reliant on Nuxt, so if a new framework shows up, or I decide to go back to vanilla JS again, I can still simply integrate all my content again.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E2. Separate your content into Projects or Buckets\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour CMS may use different nomenclature for what Cosmic calls a Project or a Bucket, but essentially, each time you&rsquo;re working on a new project you don&rsquo;t need to spin up a brand new backend necessarily. By having a single Cosmic instance,\r\nyou can spin up as many Projects or Buckets as you like.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this site I have a single Project with a single Bucket that contains all the necessary objects I need. I can then also target that Project but a separate Object to power my \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.plugins.run\"\u003EPlugins.run\u003C\u002Fa\u003E site. I could also push that Object into its own Bucket if my needs grow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut most importantly, it allowed me to spin up a new Project with some collaborators to build an exciting new \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002F_kejk\u002Fstatus\u002F1387739445944782855?s=21\"\u003EFigma plugin\u003C\u002Fa\u003E project where all content is powered by Cosmic&rsquo;s backend&hellip; how awesome is that!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E3. Automate the upload of content\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the topic of that Figma plugin, we have a lot of files to deal with from the outset (541 so far to be precise) which meant that we needed a way to get this content up quickly and easily. My collaborator \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fneef.co\u002F\"\u003ENeef\u003C\u002Fa\u003E put his skills to work and built a rad upload automation that meant we could easily post all of our files to Cosmic via the \u003Ccode\u003Eadd Object\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E endpoint by just dumping them in a folder locally and running \u003Ccode\u003Enpm run upload:assets\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E. This stopped me\r\nfrom manually doing all 541 (I&rsquo;d already done about 30 manually and that was horrible).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout a headless CMS with a solid API, this would have been entirely manual and painful when each object has 5 points of metadata that need handling. It doesn&rsquo;t sound like a lot, but that&rsquo;s repetition over 2000 times, and this was just for\r\nthe first set of data.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E4. Power anything\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing on from the above, by being able to power my website projects and also now a Figma plugin, it shows that a headless CMS can actually power anything. You could use one to power a website or app&rsquo;s content, power a plugin or integration or\r\neven just as a repository of information you want to store.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next goal is to start thinking about powering content in a native iOS app with my Cosmic CMS. Not sure on the project for this yet, but if you&rsquo;ve got ideas for something, send me an \u003Ca href=\"mailto:karl+appIdeaProject@kejk.tech\"\u003Eemail\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E5. Teach you about APIs\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, learning how to implement your content via a headless CMS teaches you how APIs work and helps you to understand the relationship between content and UI and how this separation of concerns can improve, future-proof and power any project you&rsquo;re\r\nworking on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, don&rsquo;t forget, you can go back and add a headless CMS solution to an older project. I did this with my pre-Nuxt website which used bare Vue (and thus didn&rsquo;t have the SEO benefits Nuxt brings) and it worked like a charm.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003ETime to start something!\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, a headless CMS offers freedom and power. If you&rsquo;re not sure whether one is the right fit for what you&rsquo;re doing, then I challenge you to try and find a way to make sense of it and do it. Everything you create in Cosmic is just a\r\nJSON object that can be returned via the API. So if you&rsquo;re working on anything digital, you can use that JSON to do something. So I&rsquo;d say, anything is possible!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you get stuck or want some advice, feel free to get in touch via the form below or head over to the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cosmicjs.com\u002Farticles\"\u003ECosmic community\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and see what people are building!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",modified_at:"2021-06-02T09:56:01.475Z",metadata:{published:"2021-05-02",snippet:" Not too long ago I decided to set myself a challenge; create and add new content to my website via a CMS.",tag:f,latest:a,hero:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.cosmicjs.com\u002F9fd7bf50-b580-11eb-b5b6-fd115d17c053-The-power-of-Cosmic2x.png",imgix_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimgix.cosmicjs.com\u002F9fd7bf50-b580-11eb-b5b6-fd115d17c053-The-power-of-Cosmic2x.png"}}},{slug:"getting-dry-with-figma-plugins",title:"Getting DRY with Figma plugins",content:"\u003Cp\u003EThere&rsquo;s a concept called DRY in development.

Now there are tonnes of available plugins in the Figma Community but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can find one to solve your problem, some issues are just too unique to your use case.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt HomeHero, we&rsquo;re using a bunch of custom Figma plugins that I&rsquo;ve written (including the ones I&rsquo;ve actually released)\r\nto better maintain our files. I&rsquo;ll cover some of these below.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, Figma plugins stop us from repeating ourselves with common admin tasks to clean up our files, they allow us to focus on designing the best experience instead of organising our contents.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EThe &lsquo;Gist&rsquo; of how plugins work\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of these Gists use the Scripter plugin to work as it has its own API to simplify some bits, grab it \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.figma.com\u002Fcommunity\u002Fplugin\u002F757836922707087381\u002FScripter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ehere\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

We have a bunch of phrases we write in our designs regularly thanks to our industry, and there are many times that we mistype them and this sometimes makes its way to the product\r\n(oh dear!). To avoid that, I&rsquo;ve written a super simple linter that parses the document and updates all text characters that match my arrays.

People like familiarity, it&rsquo;s human nature.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign and development for that matter are the same. Design patterns are critical for making something pleasing to the eye. Early in most creative classes you&rsquo;ll learn about the oft touted &ldquo;Golden Ratio&rdquo;. This particular number (1.618)\r\nwhen used as a compositional spacing rule, leads to the most pleasing results mathematically which happen to be aesthetically pleasing too. Why? Pattern recognition.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EUnderstanding this article\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELittered throughout this article are links to other articles and websites.

Lots of clever people have written great pieces on the things I&rsquo;m talking about here, so my goal is to collate a series of these\r\nthoughts into an abstract of sorts.

Nature is an incredible thing and the results are beautiful. If we use those patterns ourselves in music, design and development, we get beautiful results too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets break down some of the similarities between the mediums by picking some core terminology and finding some examples.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EThe rule of thirds\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn photography there&rsquo;s the concept of the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fphotographylife.com\u002Fthe-rule-of-thirds\"\u003ERule of Thirds\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, where you aim to create a pleasing proportion to your image by aligning the subject to different thirds within their containing\r\nframe. Just like all creative rules though, sometimes breaking them leads to more intriguing results, and this is very common when using the rule of thirds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn design we can use the rule of thirds when \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fdesignwebkit.com\u002Fweb-design\u002Frule-of-thirds-web-design\u002F\"\u003Elaying out a website or app\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, or when composing an article. It can often help us to pair the notion of the rule of thirds with grid\r\nlayouts. Pairing the two can lead to interesting and dynamic layouts whilst maintaining logic and legibility.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn music we can use the rule of thirds in many ways, mostly it&rsquo;s a logical way to think about breaking up a composition. Take a traditional \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.teenstarcompetition.co.uk\u002Fadvice\u002Fhow-to-write-a-pop-song\"\u003Epop song\u003C\u002Fa\u003E: intro, verse,\r\nchorus, verse, chorus, bridge, middle eight, chorus. Here, to create the catchy moment people always look forward to in songs, often the end of a pop song leverages the idea of using a bridge, then a middle eight (which is often a stripped down version\r\nof the same chorus melody) and then ending with a big final chorus. This use of a triad is one of the major reasons pop songs feel so catchy, they&rsquo;re predictable.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign and development layouts should also maintain predictability, this predictability is what makes a design usable and pleasing to look at.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EGrids\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on who you are, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.interaction-design.org\u002Fliterature\u002Farticle\u002Fthe-grid-system-building-a-solid-design-layout\"\u003Egrid systems\u003C\u002Fa\u003E are either a blessing or a curse. If we think about them the same as the rule of thirds then we&rsquo;re on the right path. Grids can be used as a definitive approach to layout or be used as an element we purposely break to provide a unique aesthetic approach. Either one is acceptable, it&rsquo;s just up to you and your layout intention.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn music we have a similar principle to grids in instrumental composition. Choosing how to &ldquo;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002FS8fZ62FrquQ\"\u003Earrange\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&rdquo; instruments is vital to the feel of a song. We can choose to have all instruments playing at once,\r\nor start with just one and build it up. Similar to grids, we can use different structural layouts to create the final song, and those different structural layouts dramatically impact the feel of the piece.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EColour theory and white space\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002F99designs.co.uk\u002Fblog\u002Ftips\u002Fthe-7-step-guide-to-understanding-color-theory\u002F\"\u003EColour theory\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, surely there isn&rsquo;t a corollary to anything in music here? Well, not so fast there champ. We can make a comparison here to the idea of\r\nharmony. Colour theory is the idea that selecting colours that are opposites on the colour wheel leads to a pleasing compositional choice as they balance each other out. Why is that? It&rsquo;s because they contain the opposite values, this fills out\r\nthe colour spectrum to its whole.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn music we have a similar thing. Have you ever wondered why the majority of songs contain drums, bass, guitars\u002Fsynths and vocals, for example? It&rsquo;s not by chance, its because these instruments fill the entire audible spectrum humans can perceive.\r\nThere are only so many frequencies that we can hear, by filling space in each of them we can create audible balance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, in both cases, we can play on this idea by breaking these rules at certain moments. Think of the famous &ldquo;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fdj.dancecult.net\u002Findex.php\u002Fdancecult\u002Farticle\u002Fdownload\u002F451\u002F457\"\u003Ebass drop\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&rdquo; in dance music, or dropping to one\r\nguitar before all coming back in, or even moments of complete silence. These are tactics musicians use to create space in the composition and therefore generate the drama and anticipation of when it kicks back in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn design we do this too by using \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fblog.prototypr.io\u002Fimportance-of-white-space-in-design-5a40c0e65bfd\"\u003Ewhite space\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to create a void between the content and colours, creating impact when we drop back in to the palette. We can also do this by dropping to a single colour for a moment and then bringing back the contrast of our secondary opposite colour to fill the visual out.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ERhythm\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can keep all your instruments together following the same rhythm and harmony. This is pleasing to the ear in the fact that it feels together and its easy to nod your head to. Alternatively, you can mix different rhythms or harmony&rsquo;s to produce interesting results. In music we have what&rsquo;s known as a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmathdrumming.com\u002Fpolyrhythms\u002F\"\u003Epolyrhythm\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. This is a rhythmic device where an instrument maintains a rhythm that falls outside of the time signature of the composition\r\nbut, thanks to some maths, falls back into time within a later phrase of the other instruments rhythm.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, in design we can use rhythm and harmony when we think about a layout. When laying out \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.jeroenseynhaeve.com\u002Fpythagoras-and-vertical-rhythm-in-typography\u002F\"\u003Etypography\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, rhythm and harmony are words that often come up. That&rsquo;s\r\nbecause what makes typography often feel pleasing to look at and read is the consistency by which the elements are laid out. If we break this typographic rhythm then it can either have pleasing results (such as for a poster design) or feel unbalanced\r\nand terrible because of a lack of visual consistency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ETime signatures and pacing\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch like rhythm, we can use other mathematical devices to play with our composition. Pacing is key to this, it allows us to think about how fast and slow the entire song should be, but also the speed of each section. Is it full time, is it half time.\r\nPlaying with the pacing is another device we can use to change the feel between sections and drive impact.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you ever listen to music I&rsquo;ve written for Echoes, we play on this idea quite often by leveraging the drama of half time. We love dropping to a final half time ending on a lot of our songs. We do this deliberately because it provides the drama\r\nand release that the build up to the moment expects.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn design we can do this too by building up different layers of composition. By having sections of your design filled with an image, text and buttons, then dropping to a section with just a single centre-aligned paragraph, then an image, and then back\r\ninto a full section with all elements. Doing this creates visual drama and dynamism. It also helps to draw attention to the right things at the right time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEqually, we can play with \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.musicnotes.com\u002Fnow\u002Ftips\u002Fa-complete-guide-to-time-signatures-in-music\u002F\"\u003Etime signatures\u003C\u002Fa\u003E which allow us to create different dynamic rhythms to create more unique feels. Jazz is full of this, but so is a lot of modern metal music.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERap and hip hop use a very common layering of 4\u002F4 backing rhythms and then rapping in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fhellomusictheory.com\u002Flearn\u002Ftriplets\u002F\"\u003Etriplets\u003C\u002Fa\u003E over the top. This is what makes the vocals feel like they&rsquo;re running at a faster pace than the lyrics and feel really fluid. You can count 1, 2, 3 in fast succession over the 4 measures to hear how it works.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn design we can use this idea visually by using contrasting grids on top of each other. Think how it would look to have your type laid out evenly over a 4 block grid but spaced as if it was a 3 block grid. It would create interest by adding additional\r\nwhite space between the words, creating a more intriguing rhythm.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ECombining our principles\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the below example, the navigation bar at the top and the two circular graphics fall on the 4x4 grid whereas the title text sits on a 3x4 grid. Just like triplets fall inside a 4\u002F4 rhythm, different grids can work in harmony to create more interesting\r\nlayouts. This combines our principles of grids, rhythm, pacing, colour theory, white space and time signatures. Almost all of them!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cfigure\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fkejk\u002Fimage\u002Fupload\u002Fv1608475542\u002FB49E0789-1597-44A0-B7D1-2668F5ED8CF0_nhp92f.png\" alt=\"3x4 text on a 4x4 layout\" class=\"rounded-lg fr-fic fr-dii\"\u003E\u003Cfigcaption\u003E3x4 text on a 4x4 layout\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\"\u003EYou&rsquo;ll likely find that you often combine many of these principles, and if you&rsquo;ve been designing or developing projects for a while then you may find you naturally use a lot of these techniques.

In Figma, a &ldquo;Project&rdquo; is a folder that contains a series of files that you work on. You can have one, several or many. In Code, we use folders (just a regular old computer folder) and inside those folders\r\nwe keep files which contain our code. Like with a Figma project, a folder can contain one, several or many files.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you work in modern Javascript-based frameworks, you&rsquo;ll likely have a whole bunch of files. If you&rsquo;re just keeping it minimal you may only use a single HTML file.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFiles == Files\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell this ones easier right? Each Figma file inside your project is essentially synonymous with the file structure of a development project. You can create multiple files within a project and link them all together with Figma&rsquo;s Shared Libraries feature.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor most development projects, especially those that utilise one of the Javascript frameworks, there will be a bunch of files that all play together nicely (hopefully) to build your site. Figma projects are no different if you take full advantage of the\r\nShared Libraries in Figma (and you should). Decentralising files is a key fundamental in modern development and allows for greater reusability and manageability of your code. Thinking of design files like this too will not only make your files more manageable\r\nbut will also create a wider synergy to your development project when it progresses.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFrames == Divs\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrames in Figma are your canvases.

If it&rsquo;s\r\nslow, you&rsquo;ll score low for SEO and with Javascript-based Single Page Apps this can be a problem, so keep an eye on it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like in Figma, Divs act as a container for your code and you can stack as many Divs inside each other as you need (just like Frames). By doing this, you build up a structure for your page. This is where it can start to take life. It&rsquo;s important\r\nto stay focused on building out the core Div structure before getting into the details. Use quick &ldquo;styles&rdquo; on your Divs to create visual separation&mdash;even if it looks garish&mdash;such as `class=&ldquo;border-2 border-black bg-red-500&rdquo;.\r\nI&rsquo;d use primary colours to separate the independent elements and stop you from nitpicking the details.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fkemiljk\u002F67631887f63e7b3b047364ef5df764f4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EThis Gist\u003C\u002Fa\u003E is an example of building up the basic structure of my home page container utilising the TailwindCSS library.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EAuto Layout == Flexbox and Grid\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the above code you&rsquo;ll see some examples of &lsquo;flex&rsquo;, &lsquo;flex-row&rsquo; and &lsquo;grid&rsquo;. These are all layout mechanisms that help to structure the page content in a more fluid and dynamic way. They&rsquo;re particularly important for when you want to create responsive layouts, such as having a 1 x 4 grid turn from a single row into a single column between desktop and mobile. This is exactly what happens in that first grid line \u003Ccode class=\"  language-html\"\u003E&lt;divclass=&quot;grid xs:grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4&quot;&gt;\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E.\r\nAt the smallest breakpoint (phone) it&rsquo;s a single column, at the next breakpoint (tablet portrait) it&rsquo;s two, and then at the next and up (tablet landscape or desktop) it turns into a four-column row. At each stage I implement a 4-point gap\r\nto separate the elements.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at the new Figma Auto Layout and Constraints controls, you&rsquo;ll see a lot of familiarity with these flex principles too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cfigure\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fkejk\u002Fimage\u002Fupload\u002Fv1608155456\u002F7BDEFC0F-89CB-4CA5-B93C-1B2A55646CEE_ewz2ye.jpg\" alt=\"An image of the Flexbox-like layout\" class=\"w-screen md:max-w-xl rounded-lg fr-fic fr-dii\"\u003E\u003Cfigcaption\u003EAn image of the Flexbox-like layout\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the above we can see the flex direction (the down and right arrow) the spacing between elements (in grid, this is the grid-space-row or grid-space-col or in TailwindCSS, gap-{n}), the overall padding (here it&rsquo;s 16px on every side) and the alignment\r\n(in our example this is align-center, justify-center).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also set resizing constraints. This defines how the object behaves when resized. We can choose between &ldquo;Hug contents&rdquo;&mdash;where the frame itself (i.e. the Div) is perfectly connected to the width of the objects inside and maintains\r\nthe padding and wrapping&mdash;or &ldquo;Fixed width&rdquo; where the the frame width never changes regardless of changes to the internal components. The same rules can be applied to the height property.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is how this looks in practice. Hug Contents is above and Fixed Width below.

I know, I know, it&rsquo;s totally boring and it&rsquo;s fine to have &lsquo;Rectangle 33201&rsquo; or &lsquo;Frame 1000010&rsquo; on your projects if the actual designs look cool. I&rsquo;ve done it many\r\ntimes too. But there is a really valid reason to think more carefully about layer naming, implementation in code.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can handover a file that&rsquo;s name logically from a layering perspective (especially if you&rsquo;ve taken all the above steps too) then you&rsquo;ll find your Engineer(s) have a much easier time implementing the code as they can use it as their\r\nfile architecture or map.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGroups should be given a name that characterises the contents. This is what can relate directly to an &lsquo;ID&rsquo; property or a &lsquo;Class&rsquo;. IDs by their very nature must be unique. In real life you can only have a single form of ID from\r\na single source, the same applies to code. You should use an ID once in your code and not again. If you find yourself repeating them then you should swap these to become classes instead.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn ID gives your particular Div or object a unique identifier which determines what makes it different. You could name a Nav Div, for example, \u003Ccode class=\"  language-text\"\u003ENAV\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E as you should only have one implementation of your core Navigation and reuse that component everywhere (more on this later). If that is true, ID it as \u003Ccode class=\"  language-text\"\u003ENAV\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E and apply the relevant classes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice the use of uppercase. Everyone has different practices, but one I think is particularly useful is to use UPPERCASE words to represent IDs and kebab-case for classes. But really you can do what you want. The reason for a difference? Scanability.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EStyles == Classes\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, in Figma, if you find yourself reusing a particular style everywhere then you&rsquo;ve probably decided (at least I hope so) to create a Figma Style from it. Doing this allows you to create local Text Styles, Color Styles and Effect Styles for a\r\ndocument. That way, repetition is more easy to do and consistency is more likely to be had.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn code we do this too, they&rsquo;re known as classes. Depending on whether you&rsquo;re using a CSS library (like \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftailwindcss.com\u002F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ETailwindCSS\u003C\u002Fa\u003E) or not will likely determine your approach to classes. Tailwind uses what are known as &lsquo;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fadamwathan.me\u002Fcss-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns\u002F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EUtility Classes\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&rsquo;, essentially breaking classes up into atomic parts (see: \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fatomicdesign.bradfrost.com\u002F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAtomic Design\u003C\u002Fa\u003E). What this means in practice is, like in my example earlier, there&rsquo;s lots of bitty classes used to\r\nbuild up a base idea.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust look at this button: \u003Ccode class=\"  language-html\"\u003E&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot;class=&quot;flex flex-row w-full justify-center text-center font-medium btn btn-primary rounded-xl px-6 py-3 bg-blue-400 text-white hover:bg-blue-500 focus:outline-none focus:shadow-outline transition duration-500 ease&quot;&gt;Button 1\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&lt;\u002F\u003C\u002Fspan\u003Ebutton\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&gt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat&rsquo;s a big ol&#39; lot of classes to get the button behaving how I want. But equally, it behaves how I want. I&rsquo;ve have complete control in the place I&rsquo;m creating the button, instead of relying on styling in a separate CSS file. And, once you learn the notation style, it actually gets pretty fast to write (see: \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fbrianlovin.com\u002Foverthought\u002Ftailwind-css-first-impressions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EBrian Lovin on migrating to TailwindCSS\u003C\u002Fa\u003E).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next logical step, of course, is to reduce the amount you do this. And you do this, just like in Figma, through making reusable elements called Components.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EComponents == Components\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow on to the final piece of the puzzle. You&rsquo;ve written a bunch of stuff, but you find yourself copying and pasting it all the time. Doesn&rsquo;t it seem silly to do that? Couldn&rsquo;t it be easier?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where component based design and development comes in. Breaking things up into reusable chunks makes it easier to manage a big build and increases consistency. The beauty of Components too, is that you can decide how atomic you want to make them.\r\nAtomic Design (mentioned earlier) is the extreme end of the spectrum, but if you&rsquo;re already using TailwindCSS then you&rsquo;ve already got a bunch of atomic elements to play with.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I dissect my site, I have:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFour core unique pages\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOne subpage (for blog posts)\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFourteen components\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could be much more atomic with my components. If it was a commercial product, I would be, but the reality is that I don&rsquo;t need to be that strict about it. I&rsquo;m building it to my needs, just like I would a personal Figma file. The most important\r\npart of creating a component of anything is thinking about who&rsquo;s going to use it. Think of your website the same way you think of a Figma Design System. If you created icons with their labels as components, do the same, they&rsquo;ll be easier to\r\nswap out in a conditional statement. If you created different card component types, do the same, again you can use conditionals to control data differences.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EConclusion\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you&rsquo;re working with engineers on a project, talk it through with them. Ask them how they&rsquo;re planning to execute at a code level and build your project to match. If they&rsquo;re going atomic, go atomic. It&rsquo;ll feel tough in the beginning\r\nbut the 1:1 match will be worth it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost importantly though, learn to make these connections in your head. If you can map what you think of in design to what the end engineering build case could be, you&rsquo;ll find that the process of documenting design decisions and handing over projects\r\nbecome far easier.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",modified_at:"2021-05-15T13:25:01.001Z",metadata:{published:"2020-12-18",snippet:"My personal approach on how to think about code from a design perspective and how to implement those changes.",tag:e,hero:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.cosmicjs.com\u002Fd60a4250-b580-11eb-b5b6-fd115d17c053-Thinking-in-design-code2x.png",imgix_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimgix.cosmicjs.com\u002Fd60a4250-b580-11eb-b5b6-fd115d17c053-Thinking-in-design-code2x.png"},latest:a}},{slug:"dont-let-your-role-define-you",title:"Don’t let your role define you",content:"\u003Cp\u003EThis article started off life as an essay on my career.

None of this was by accident but it certainly wasn&#39;t planned. I just kept pushing for and pursuing the path I wanted and felt most\r\ncomfortable in. You need to do the same. A lot of employers admire people who&#39;ve trodden a unique path because they bring skills others wouldn&#39;t. Be that person.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFight the voice inside that tells you that you&#39;re not worthy&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere isn&#39;t a day that I don&#39;t experience imposter syndrome. I&#39;m constantly in disbelief that I&#39;m actually a designer somewhere. I&#39;m still convinced I &quot;shouldn&#39;t be allowed&quot; because I followed an unconventional path.\r\nBut I am a designer, I do that job and I do it well. It&#39;s hard to fight the negative feelings but you have to remember that you were hired for a reason. You didn&#39;t lie to get there (hopefully), so just keep doing what you do. Someone will tell\r\nyou if you&#39;re not up to scratch.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EDon&#39;t be afraid to learn&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one is probably obvious, but seriously, keep learning. I&#39;ve never stopped trying to get to the bottom of things and become better at the core skills I need to deliver my job. But equally, I keep pushing to learn more. Teaching myself SwiftUI\r\nso I can feel closer to engineering&#39;s implementation of our designs, teaching myself Javascript frameworks to be able to build my own personal site and understand the basics of APIs. These are all fundamental to the products we ship, as designers\r\nwe should know how they work too.

Trust me.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EBe comfortable with being uncomfortable&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet uncomfortable. Push yourself to that point. Then sit there, in it, for a while. Get used to that feeling, it&#39;ll help massively with that voice that tells you you&#39;re not worthy. The more you get used to feeling uncomfortable, the more you&#39;ll be comfortable with it. Psychologists often use \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.psychologytools.com\u002Fprofessional\u002Ftechniques\u002Fexposure\u002F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eexposure therapy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to help people overcome their fears. Slowly introducing them to the thing that makes them uncomfortable for longer and longer times until they eventually become comfortable. Do that to yourself. Offer to do a Lunch and Learn on a topic to the entire team, take on that Webflow project when you&#39;ve never used it before, offer to man the phones for a couple of hours to deal with customers. Whatever makes you uncomfortable, push yourself to try it, you&#39;ll see it&#39;s not that bad and you&#39;ll grow tenfold because of it.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EDon&#39;t give up&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you&#39;ve not had that flip yet and you&#39;re still in a role you feel defines you even though it&#39;s not the &quot;you&quot; you want to be; don&#39;t give up.

Seek opportunities in your current business to push into areas you want to be in, even be as bold as to ask your manager if there is any chance.

The leap from HTML and CSS to React was massive and it put me off.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvuejs.org\"\u003EVue\u003C\u002Fa\u003E! I stumbled across Vue by accident. I knew I wanted to learn something more reactive so I started searching around, found Vue and it just clicked instantly. I dropped the CDN script into a prototype project I was working on at \u003Ca href=\"www.neuerenergy.com\"\u003ENeuerEnergy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and I was away. I could write the HTML and CSS I knew, and then inject some Javascript in&mdash;when I wanted to and had learned to&mdash;to power up the site with clever reactivity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then my love of Vue began and I decided the best way to learn it better was to rebuild my personal website in Vue. So welcome \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fkejk.kejk.now.sh\"\u003EKEJK v2\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. I decided that because we&rsquo;d been leveraging the power of Material Design at NeuerEnergy, I wanted to do the same for my personal website (avoiding too much brain overload) and thus found the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvuetifyjs.com\u002Fen\u002F\"\u003EVuetify library\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to help me on my journey. This meant I could build in the same way I could design, using a design framework that already made sense to me. If I wanted a card, Vuetify had a \u003Ccode class=\" py-2  language-html\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&lt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003Ev-card\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&gt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E to offer me, if I wanted to break into a grid, I had \u003Ccode class=\" py-2  language-html\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&lt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003Ev-row\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&gt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E and \u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&lt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003Ev-col\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&gt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fcode\u003Eto\r\nhelp me out. It all just made sense.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EVue, Nuxt, Cosmic, Drafts and TailwindCSS\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI loved that personal site, it also provided me with a lot of interest from prospective employers when applying for other design roles. Being able to tell them that I&rsquo;d built the website myself and used Vue to do so gave me a level of skill that other designers weren&rsquo;t always able to offer. This doesn&rsquo;t mean I was \u003Cem\u003Ebetter\u003C\u002Fem\u003E in any way, I just offered \u003Cem\u003Edifferent\u003C\u002Fem\u003E skills and sometimes those skills are super helpful for the right design team.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found that exact design team. In my current role at \u003Ca href=\"www.homehero.co.uk\"\u003EHomeHero\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, I was hired specifically because I could span the breadth of design and development. Connecting Design and Engineering teams is often an overwhelming and complex task. More often than not, projects aren&rsquo;t handed over properly and a lot of important information is either lost in translation or just straight up missed. Usually, this isn&rsquo;t the fault of anyone particularly, better processes could help (I&rsquo;ll be writing about this at some point soon) but also understanding the language of development and being able to understand \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhat it takes\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E to deliver on your grand &ldquo;cross-device isometric animated timeline&rdquo; can have a massive, lasting impact on the connectedness of your team and the quality of the outcome. Moreover, I&rsquo;m able to work directly with the Engineering team to style the frontend of some of our projects, lifting a weight off of them and giving Design the power to own the interface from idea to execution.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what was next for me? Well, as you can see there were two iterations of my previous site but you&rsquo;re reading this on the third. I realised that I had an opportunity to improve things. I wanted to make my content more reactive and allow myself more opportunities to utilise a headless CMS to power a lot of the content that could change regularly. This is when I came across \u003Ca href=\"www.cosmicjs.com\"\u003ECosmicJS\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Cosmic is a super flexible, \u003Cstrong\u003Ereally well documented\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E headless CMS (with an unbelievably generous free tier). Cosmic has allowed me to power pages such as my \u003Ca href=\"www.kejk.tech\u002Fthoughts\"\u003EThoughts\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (where you&rsquo;re reading this) and \u003Ca href=\"www.kejk.tech\u002Fuses\"\u003EUses\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Now I can update content via Cosmic&rsquo;s\r\nsimple backend, avoiding any need to dive into the code to create a new blog post or update my gear.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, I&rsquo;m writing this on \u003Ca href=\"www.getdrafts.com\"\u003EDrafts\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for iPad and will be posting it to my Cosmic bucket using a custom \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Factions.getdrafts.com\u002Fa\u002F1fP\"\u003EPOST action\u003C\u002Fa\u003E I wrote. This makes things frictionless for me now.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;ve also refactored the site to use \u003Ca href=\"www.nuxtjs.org\"\u003ENuxt.js\u003C\u002Fa\u003E so I can take better advantage of dynamic page routing, SEO meta info and their module system. I even went as far as to ditch my use of Material Design and refactored all of the HTML to use \u003Ca href=\"www.tailwindcss.com\"\u003ETailwindCSS\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. This means I&rsquo;m looking up docs less and focusing on writing code in a way my brain already thinks&hellip; in CSS.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ESo what&rsquo;s the future?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;m not really sure where I go next with things. I can probably better implement Cosmic into my site, making more content dynamic. I also want to write some more Drafts actions to try and make things like updating a post more straightforward. But\r\nother than that, I&rsquo;m feeling really excited about where things are and what I&rsquo;ve managed to teach myself.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;ve said it before several times, but I urge you if you&rsquo;re a designer who&rsquo;s working with developers; learn the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, try out a framework like Vue + Nuxt (give SwiftUI a try too). They&rsquo;re all becoming\r\nso much more accessible to people without programming knowledge already (or a more visually-focused brain like me) and I promise it&rsquo;ll be worth it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can do it, so can you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",modified_at:"2021-05-15T13:25:56.711Z",metadata:{published:"2020-12-10",snippet:"How development can be learned through a design lens (and how I've managed to do it).

Arguably, the vast majority of Creatives are precious people. From my own personal experience, observing teammates and generally speaking to other creatives, it&rsquo;s apparent that we seek perfection and are often uncomfortable\r\nwith sharing works in progress.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you work in design, you&rsquo;ll be familiar with the WIP abbreviation. You might have used it in file extensions \u003Ccode class=\"  language-text\"\u003E`homepage_redesign-WIP.fig`\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E or within the document itself \u003Ccode class=\"  language-text\"\u003E`homepage_newScreens-WIP`\u003C\u002Fcode\u003Eor you may go as far as using more blunt language to try and stop prying eyes \u003Ccode class=\"  language-text\"\u003E`homepage_newScreens-NotReadyYet-DO_NOT_TOUCH`\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I moved to HomeHero, I was one of two designers. The very nature of having two individuals meant that we were somewhat forced into working in the open. We, in most cases, would be working across the same files because of the needs of the organisation\r\nat the time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing we did though, was use Figma. By default, Figma&rsquo;s goal is to enable and encourage working out in the open. Whether that&rsquo;s through the cross-platform, web-based tool&rsquo;s easy sharing options, or the multi-cursor features, it became\r\nsuper easy for us to bring product managers and developers into the fold too.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we&rsquo;ve grown, we&rsquo;ve ensured that we maintain this approach to working. Although we only open access to our files once they&rsquo;re in the right shape, we actively seek product manager and developer input during the early stages of design.\r\nAllowing them in to the fold when the file is still a mess of ideas and mistakes ensures that we don&rsquo;t spend too long going down the wrong path or thinking we&rsquo;ve understood the brief but we&rsquo;ve actually got it hugely wrong.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EBeing consistent\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all well and good, but it&rsquo;s easy to lose consistency with this and retreat back to the WIP-obsessed designer mindset.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe&rsquo;ve done it as a team. We started with really open access in Figma. Anyone with a HomeHero email address could just jump in to any file and have a nose around and have their say. We experienced a few moments where we got some unhelpful feedback\r\non parts of a project that were just experiments. And the problem is, no matter what the page was labelled or what text is included on the page, it&rsquo;s not always clear to an outsider that something is an experiment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt&rsquo;s not an issue just for us as designers. Receiving unnecessary feedback isn&rsquo;t helpful, and it&rsquo;s also a huge waste of time for the person who spent their precious hours adding comments to something that was a passing idea anyway.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFinding a happy medium\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to maintain our openness across the organisation, whilst also ensuring we don&rsquo;t fall into the old traps, we&rsquo;ve spent some time crafting a way forwards.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch4\u003EOur default position is that only Design have Figma access to our Team now.\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that only the design team have open access across all the Figma documents we&rsquo;ve created. This allows us to be working out in the open within the confines of the Design Team. It stops us from keeping our ideas just to ourselves, obsessing\r\nover them until they&rsquo;re &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;, but it also ensures we don&rsquo;t end up in the land of unnecessary comments.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch4\u003EWe add the relevant PM, Developer and and others to a singular, specific file.\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy only adding the right people to the right file at the right time, we guarantee that we&rsquo;ve put the file into the right kind of state to receive the feedback we need, but without resorting to &nbsp;\u003Ccode class=\"  language-text\"\u003E`homepage_redesign-final_FINAL.fig`\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch4\u003EWe design together, live.\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing we spend a lot of time doing now&mdash;beyond collaborating inside the same design files&mdash;is actually designing whilst sharing our screen.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we&rsquo;re working through a specific problem, we&rsquo;ve found that screen sharing-based design sessions work great.

What are the things that they say to hook potential or existing customers? And why does this matter?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, let&rsquo;s start with a story. Early on in my career, I was a sales person. I left University with a Masters in Fine Art but didn&rsquo;t feel I was worthy of a design or development role (despite developing skills in both places for around 10\r\nyears prior) so I went from my full-time retail job at Apple to working as an Account Executive in pharmaceutical advertising. My job was to keep projects on track, win new business and keep clients happy. I was solely responsible for selling the vision\r\nof our design and development teams and ensure coordination and clarification across the board.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it came to meetings, I had to work hard to explain how something had been done, why it would take 2 months to build &ldquo;that&rdquo; feature and why they couldn&rsquo;t have the &ldquo;other&rdquo; feature they wanted. Throughout that process,\r\nI learnt the intricacies and nuances of behaviour, of the complexity of communicating something widely understood by designers and developers, but deeply misunderstood by customers. I expanded skills learnt from Apple Retail about how to explain the complex\r\nin a simple way, breaking technology down to its simplest form and developing similes and metaphors for different approaches. All of this led to accurate communication and valuable insight into the customer experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, fast forward to now. Now I design and develop the frontend experience of products. From initial idea through to final execution. Throughout this process, I have regular touch points with our sales team to ensure that each feature is developed deeply\r\ninline with the requirements of our target market and explain why we&rsquo;ve designed it one way, or developed it another. Why it can&rsquo;t be exactly like that thing they showed me that one time that kind of did the same thing. Why it&rsquo;s going\r\nto take six months to develop that special graph that takes data from 56 sources, runs a machine learning algorithm to extract the most valuable insights, feeds it back into the UI and generates a personalised graph in real-time with up-to-the-second\r\ndata.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I also go to those meetings, sit in on those calls, talk to those potential customers and explain these things myself. Explain our UI decisions in detail. Spend hours in workshops justifying decisions and ensuring our customers see why. And in these\r\nworkshops, our sales team learn. They learn how we think about design and development decisions, why we push back when we do, and how to communicate this to customers. They learn to not promise the earth and that it&rsquo;ll be delivered in 2 weeks. They\r\nlearn to speak in a language that is both technical and customer-centric.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens, is both sides learn how to communicate better. With each other, with the customer, with their peers. Designers and developers learn how to sell. Sales people learn how to communicate technological ideas and not over promise.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone wins.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, by tightly coupling sales with the technology teams, the result is a wonderful world where all parties are working to the same goal and with the same attitudes, understanding and beliefs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E team must be \u003Cstrong\u003Eone\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E team.

It can be right there in front of you, seeing children living longer lives because of the work you and the healthcare\r\ncompany you support do. But it&rsquo;s also sometimes easy to think about those end individuals as &lsquo;users&rsquo;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUser Experience is a hot topic and has been for some time. Really, it was birthed in Silicon Valley as a way of thinking about the end person using your product and avoid a narrow focus on delivering a solution that you (as in the company) think is the\r\nright thing. The problem with a user focus is that it&rsquo;s easy to abstract the term user into being a statistic. A user is a term we attribute onto a person that uses our product, but it is far too easy for that to become a percentage on a spreadsheet\r\nor a cumulative number that appears on an analytics report. Treating the people we affect most as users can have a negative effect on how we think about our products and lead us to believe that our focus is on increasing that percentage or building up\r\nthose numbers, only.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch4\u003EWhy we should be Human-centred\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuman-centered design is a term that&#39;s been explored and advocated for by many established designers from David and Tom Kelley, to Donald Norman and even into architecture by way of Mike Cooley.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy argument is for a permanant change, a move away from user-centricity and user experience and towards human-centricity and human-experience. By doing this, we can&rsquo;t abstract away who we are affecting. Those directly effected are other humans and\r\nas such, it helps focus the mind on doing our best work and allows to think more wholly about what we&rsquo;re creating.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENumbers are important, we need to keep an eye on those analytics reports and the statistics from audience feedback, but that needn&rsquo;t draw away from the very humans that we are affecting. Sometimes, decisions that may seem bad statistically, are\r\nactually right ethically. Making decisions that directly impact on the humans using your product are often some of the hardest and most important. Losing sight of those real people that you&rsquo;re affecting with every slight change of pixels on a UI,\r\nremoval of &lsquo;old&rsquo; functionality or choice of distribution platform, can have lasting effects on their respect for your company and the values you represent.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo think carefully about every decision you make as a brand and contemplate the impact on the humans you&rsquo;re working for, because no matter what you believe, the other humans of this earth are the people you&rsquo;re helping and those humans need\r\nyou to care about them first.
