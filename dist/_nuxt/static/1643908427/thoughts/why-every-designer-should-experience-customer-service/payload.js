Whilst not always true, often the reason for your employment is because the team is currently understaffed and need additional bodies to help get things done or that there&rsquo;s a big new feature\u002Fproduct area that needs work and another colleague is needed to deliver that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen this is the case, it&rsquo;s easy to overlook the value of ensuring that new employees experience a bit of frontline action. And in the case of my new role as a Product Designer at \u003Ca href=\"%22https%3A\u002F\u002Fwww.moneyboxapp.com%22\"\u003EMoneybox\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, the experience I&rsquo;ve had so far is as a frontline customer service (CS) agent. My first two weeks are being spent alongside the wider CS team, learning about our customers&#39; pain points first-hand, as well as those moments of delight&mdash;such as someone being able to buy their first home thanks to our LISA&mdash;and providing them with world class customer service.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the first time as a designer that I&rsquo;ve not been designing something from day one, and honestly, it&rsquo;s the best feeling. Whilst I&rsquo;m itching to get started on my first design project, easing into a company who&rsquo;s product I&rsquo;ve used as a customer for the past 4 years by experiencing the CS role has been one of the most enjoyable onboarding experiences I&rsquo;ve had.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I&rsquo;ve seen a trend; \u003Cem\u003Ethings that come up via CS enquiries turn into new product features. Period\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Obviously this can&rsquo;t be true for everything we hear, including many customer feature requests, but for anything that is a clear customer issue that appears regularly, this is 100% the case. And this tells me something important; at Moneybox we care about our customer experience and it is embodied throughout the business.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe common requests that come up often (I can&rsquo;t talk specifics right now due to them being unreleased features) aren&rsquo;t things that we can&rsquo;t resolve already. Two of our new features are really straightforward to handle from our CS admin. But the truth of the matter is, a customer should \u003Cem\u003Ejust be able to do it themselves\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing. We&rsquo;re shipping features to make that true. And that embodies for me a culture of customer care and one of shipping necessary features often. It shows a connectedness across the business, from CS to Ops, Design to Development, Insight to Marketing. All of these departments are interconnected, and, woven throughout all of this is a desire to do the best for our customers. That&rsquo;s a place I want to be. Period.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EKey takeaways\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECustomers do often know exactly what they want, but they won&rsquo;t always express it.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Look for common pain points amongst the vast base of customers you or your colleagues speak to. Dig into the underlying need, don&rsquo;t take what they say at face value as a feature request.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECustomer Service is hard.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Even with pre-written responses to the most common questions, it&rsquo;s a repetitive and demanding task to say the same things over and over with a positive attitude. It&rsquo;s also relentless. Take a moment to be grateful for your CS team and maybe have a coffee chat with one of them next week. Thank them for their efforts.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENot doing your day job from day one is a really great way to start a new role.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E For all you managers out there, not trying to get a new employee to hit the ground running from day one is actually a really good thing. It&rsquo;ll help you to get the most out of them when they do actually start their role officially, and it&rsquo;ll help them to appreciate more of the wider business. Whilst intros to different departments are useful, they&rsquo;re a far cry from actually having to do the job for a bit.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESecondments can be really valuable.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Ask your employer for secondments into other areas of the business, even if just for a day, if you feel it&rsquo;ll enhance your role to do so. As a designer, spending time with CS, marketing\u002Finsights or development could have a significant positive impact on your day-to-day and allow you to see opportunities to improve your processes or push for a specific feature to be promoted in importance.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuild a culture of connectedness.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E By encouraging departmental secondments, you ensure that you build a wider respect for different departments and connect your teams through action. A sales colleague may gain great value from spending time with marketing to understand how the product is sold direct to the consumer; a marketing colleague may find value in joining data science for a short time to gather insight about how they think about data; a data scientist may benefit from spending time with insight to see the true impact of the latest feature shipped. Not all secondments are created equal, but there&rsquo;s so much value that can be gained from time spent in another department.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll have plenty more to say, but for now, these are my immediate raw thoughts on the process of being a CS for my first week. Ultimately, a secondment like this is nothing but a positive experience so if it&rsquo;s possible to do this in your company for new hires, make sure you do!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",metadata:{published:"2021-07-18",snippet:"It's common when joining a new company to get thrown straight in at the deep end.
