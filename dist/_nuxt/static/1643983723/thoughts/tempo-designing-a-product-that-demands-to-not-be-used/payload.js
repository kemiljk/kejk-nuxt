I don&rsquo;t actually remember where I first heard about it, but as someone who values the principles of minimalism and essentialism, it suits me down to a tee.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETempo is a minimalist email client, aimed at reducing the amount you pick it up and avoiding the constant barrage of email noise and distraction of modern personal and business life.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmail clients really are a dime a dozen, it&rsquo;s an area of app stores that is ripe with implementation but mostly misses on true differentiation. Whilst it&#39;s very easy to find another email client to test out instead of the default one installed on your device, it&rsquo;s very hard to find one that actually offers something different. Tempo, however, is \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C\u002Fem\u003E email client.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs someone in the product design world, I&rsquo;ve often been tasked with designing strategies and affordances that encourage product usage. Pulling people in via notifications, including &ldquo;tasks&rdquo; for customers to do in order to get them using\r\nthe app when they might not need to, working with marketing to develop campaigns to encourage upsells. These things are important for business often, but they&rsquo;re at odds with what we as people actually want most of the time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETempo, unlike most products, demands to be put down. From its ultra-minimal aesthetic to its approach to email batching, it doesn&rsquo;t want you to open it up and pull to refresh every five minutes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere&rsquo;s a couple of things about Tempo that I think are super important to its current and future success and some key things I think any brand can learn from them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E1. Batching\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETempo&rsquo;s first unique feature is its approach to informing you about email. Rather than sending you a single notification for every email, you receive, instead, when you set up Tempo (or wish to add additional Batching slots) you define time windows\r\nthat you want to receive the emails and Tempo holds onto them until that time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.cosmicjs.com\u002F750c7ad0-fda7-11eb-aaf9-c7d10ae67fc2-IMG0989.PNG\" class=\"w-full fr-fic fr-dib fr-rounded\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you ever need to see them before then&mdash;such as awaiting that important client brief or the outcome of your potential promotion&mdash;you can either peek at them or force a new batch to be delivered. If you don&rsquo;t do this, you&rsquo;ll just\r\nreceive a single notification to declare that a new batch is ready which will then allow you to see what&rsquo;s waiting for your attention.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis focus on batching helps you to focus on what you do best, designing or developing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKey takeaway: Spend time thinking about the most important thing you can do for your customer and make that your hallmark feature. Even if it feels at odds with the industry, do it anyway. You can allow overrides where necessary, but don&rsquo;t make\r\nthem easy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E2. Not being demanding of customer time\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of time, Tempo cares about your time. We all know that async communications often take up lots of our working and personal time. With email, we had our first experience of this, and over time with the introduction of text messages everywhere,\r\nSlack, Teams, and more, we have limitless things wanting our limited attention.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETempo&rsquo;s batching focus allows you to get on with the things that matter most in your day and only care about email when the time comes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mobile beta takes this seriously too, limiting the functionality so you&rsquo;re focused on either dealing with the batched email by sorting and replying or pushing emails into &#39;To Do&#39; for later.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.cosmicjs.com\u002Fa68d0e80-fda7-11eb-aaf9-c7d10ae67fc2-IMG0985.PNG\" class=\"w-full fr-fic fr-dib fr-rounded\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis limited functionality is by design. This speaks to Tempo&rsquo;s mission of making email less distracting and their desire to build with love and design with purpose.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKey takeaway: Think about how much time your customer has and optimise your product to minimise how much of it you ask for. Think about whether you \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E need to send that push notification.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E3. Thinking people-first\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere&rsquo;s a lot of tools designed to &ldquo;make you more productive&rdquo; but often they don&rsquo;t actually succeed because instead of removing the noise and simplifying things, they bloat out their offering and encourage you to spend more of\r\nyour time on their product. That demand for your time is against what Tempo believes in and is in fact a direct opposite of what Tempo expects.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can look to their domain to think about how they feel about you as a customer. \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.yourtempo.co\"\u003Ewww.yourtempo.co\u003C\u002Fa\u003E is very explicit that it&rsquo;s about being &ldquo;yours&rdquo;. This subtleness to the domain is a surprisingly important and significant one. It shows how Tempo feels about you as a customer or prospective customer. They want you to feel as though the product is yours and not the other way around. Tempo works for \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKey takeaway: Be people-first. It&rsquo;s easy to create a product that achieves your goals but trying to do that whilst also understanding about and caring for your customer is hard. Put yourself in their shoes, would you want what your about to do to\r\nhappen to you?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E4. Beautiful but utilitarian design (function over form)\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy design, Tempo is intentionally minimal. The interface and affordances are kept stripped and colourless. There&rsquo;s a few minor moments of colour when it feels useful to explain visually what is happening, such as the green toggles to enable or disable\r\naccounts or batching per account, or swipe actions or the tiny blue indicator to show an item is new. These moments are kept for items that afford action. This helps it to be really clear on what elements are interactive versus passive.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe default &#39;compose&#39; window for new emails or replies utilises markdown by default so you can quickly and easily format emails without having to mess around with rich text buttons or cluttered editing experiences.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 w-full gap-4\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.cosmicjs.com\u002Ffb960210-fda7-11eb-aaf9-c7d10ae67fc2-IMG1020.PNG\" class=\"w-full fr-fic fr-dii\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.cosmicjs.com\u002Fde325b60-fda7-11eb-aaf9-c7d10ae67fc2-IMG1021.PNG \" class=\"w-full fr-fic fr-rounded fr-dii\"\u003E\r\n\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.cosmicjs.com\u002F1bd24430-fda8-11eb-aaf9-c7d10ae67fc2-IMG0987.PNG \" class=\"w-full fr-fic fr-rounded fr-dii\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.cosmicjs.com\u002F23b3a180-fda8-11eb-aaf9-c7d10ae67fc2-IMG0988.png \" class=\"w-full fr-fic fr-rounded fr-dii\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther email apps tend to bloat the editing interface with lots of action bars and abilities to format everything under the sun. Whilst this could be useful, it can lead to spending too much time creating the email and less time focusing on what matters\r\nmost as a designer or developer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKey takeaway: Your interfaces can be simple, it&rsquo;s okay to not fill them with coloured buttons, illustrations, animations or other decorations. Sometimes the simplicity is what brings the true beauty because it allows your product&rsquo;s functions\r\nto be key. As Dieter Rams put it, &ldquo;Good design is as little design as possible&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E5. Building with intentionality\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, Tempo&rsquo;s compose view on desktop includes a type length indicator that recommends keeping your message to the length of a tweet. Whilst this isn&rsquo;t always useful or correct for your use case, it helps to remind you to be intentional\r\nwith your messages.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether you&rsquo;re replying or writing a brand new message, this indicator is present. It&rsquo;s another moment that introducers colour when you go over that intentional length. The more you use it, the more you&rsquo;ll get comfortable with shortening\r\nyour emails and think of them more like text messages when the time is right.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally though, intentionality sums up the entire product and the ethos of the company. And this is demonstrated end to end within Tempo.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKey takeaway: Intentionality is key. Be intentional with every decision you make from design of the interface, to the stack you&rsquo;re building with, to the customer journeys you focus on and the way you solve your customers&#39; problems. All of this\r\nneeds to be intentional from the outset. Your product and your customers will benefit in the long run.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn&rsquo;t recommend it enough, and if you want to give it try, you can sign up via \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.yourtempo.co\u002Fref?code=JG31WQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer \" target=\"_blank\r\n\"\u003Emy link\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to get a 30-day free trial. After that, it&rsquo;s &euro;10 a month, and it&rsquo;s totally worth it. The time saved alone makes you more than &euro;10 a month more productive with your time.
