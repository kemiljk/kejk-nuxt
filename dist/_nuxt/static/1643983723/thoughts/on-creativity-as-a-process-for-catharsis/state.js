Understanding the core principles and basic architecture of the platform you&rsquo;re creating for gives your team the best chance of great outcomes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the sake of this post, I&rsquo;ll focus on my craft as a designer but you can apply this more broadly to any role. We all have adjacent teams and roles that are impacted directly by our work so understanding them at their core is essential.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the first things I ever built and shipped was my initial Figma plugin (then called Px&rsaquo;&rsaquo;Em and now \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.figma.com\u002Fcommunity\u002Fplugin\u002F837070613195594890\"\u003EHand&rsaquo;&rsaquo;over\u003C\u002Fa\u003E). The original intention of that plugin was to make it easy to convert Figma design pixels into ems. I later upgraded this to be rem focused so that you could adjust your baseline pixel value and added more canvas detection features. This then evolved into a Mac, iOS and iPadOS \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapps.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Fapp\u002Fid1518887590\"\u003Eapp\u003C\u002Fa\u003E because I wanted to use it for myself and because I fancied learning SwiftUI.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now I&rsquo;m wondering if the name is right&hellip;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;ve come to realise through my time across multiple startups, moving between design-only and design-engineering hybrid roles that a design is never really handed over. The physical files may be sent via a link or exported and shipped, but the learning and conversation, the heated debates on delivery, the nitpicking over alignment doesn&rsquo;t stop. And as such, the handover never actually happened.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHandover implies responsibility is passed on. Handshake implies responsibility is shared.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn retrospect, the handover only really happens when it reaches the customer and even then, if you&rsquo;re working in the right way, you iterate and learn, and then subsequently evolve the project further. Rinse and repeat. Handover never happened.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorking with designers at different stages in their careers and different levels of engineering knowledge, it becomes evident that for some, handing over offers a relief. A way to move responsibility off of their shoulders and onto someone else&rsquo;s. Or to feel that their job is done and now it&rsquo;s time to move on to the next thing. As such a handover implies responsibility is passed on, a Handshake however, implies responsibility is shared.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fast paced environments, this is certainly often true. But the best teams work like an organism, harmonious in form and consistently sharing resources and forever communicating. In an environment like that, hard handovers can&rsquo;t ever truly happen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo give another practical example. If an engineer was delivering a feature but hit a stopping point because something was missing from the original designs, should they a) stop work entirely, hand it back to the designer and wait? Or b) raise the issue with the designer, work to reach a conclusion together, and then carry on?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;m guessing we&rsquo;d all pick B. Well, that sounds an awful lot more like a handshake to me. An agreement, a shared understanding, teamwork, partnership.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ESo how do you design for Handshakes?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere&rsquo;s five key points that really lead to great handshakes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003EInvolve your developers early and often\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EShare ideas\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDesign together\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKeep connected\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDevelop a bondï¿¼\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E1. Involve your developers early and often\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat teams work together throughout the course of a project. Rather than relying on finite touch points, they focus on passing the baton whilst continuing to run alongside their team mates, ready to take the baton again when their time comes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe earlier and more often you involve developers in your process, the less likely designs are to be handed over and become undeliverable or need iterating.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you&rsquo;re ready to handshake, grab your developer and walk through the codable iteration of your work. Pass on the files and keep in constant communication as the project develops.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E2. Share ideas\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe open to sharing developer thoughts and ideas. Design isn&rsquo;t about gatekeeping so welcome a collaborative and open atmosphere, and let your developer challenge you during the entire process. The more you share, the more you understand each other and the more you&rsquo;ll be able to riff off each other to get to the best result.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you foster a good enough bond here, you may even be able to be less specific in certain design processes as your developer will know how you think (and visa versa) and as such, can make valid assumptions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEqually, you&rsquo;ll develop a better understanding of how your product actually works, and as such, learn to make better decisions initially before agreeing on final designs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E3. Design together\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis collaborative space should invite co-designing. I challenge you to invite a developer into your file as you work, talk at the same time, design in real time. Getting comfortable with live designing will make a world of difference. You won&rsquo;t get your deepest work done, but you&rsquo;ll ensure the designs are developer friendly from the get go.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInvite questions. Invite challenges. Challenge them back. Think of this as your safe place to thrash ideas out.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E4. Keep connected\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce your designs are feeling ready to go, don&rsquo;t lose that connection. Whether you have regular stand ups, async chats, or use Loom to share progress, make sure you stay connected.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the designer it&rsquo;s your responsibility to encourage this and foster it within your developer. If you want to handshake rather than handover, own this part of the process.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E5. Develop a bond\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, you should evolve a stronger bond with your developer. This will make a big difference in the long term as they&rsquo;ll feel safer with sharing honest feedback, they&rsquo;ll make better default assumptions or decisions and they&rsquo;ll welcome the idea of working with you again.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis bond is one of the most important in a software development business because it ensures that what ships to customers is the best it can possibly be. Providing the idea is the right one, this execution phase is critical to success so if you can nail this process, you can be confident in the outcomes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFinding the nuance\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt&rsquo;s all well and good for me to say that handovers aren&rsquo;t right. This is merely my belief based on working with handshakes for most of my design career. Understanding how the development process works develops a deeper empathy for the difficulties these days to do with responsiveness, unpredictable screen sizes, data rates, device themes, accessibility settings and more. There&rsquo;s so much to contend with, and building these great partnerships rather than transactions will leave your product feeling better than it ever did.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you share your process with your teams too. Be the leader of the handshake within your organisation and upskill other designers, developers and anyone else in the business on this collaborative process.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you end up trying this handshake approach, let me know how you get on.

Steve Jobs famously enjoyed taking long walks to develop an idea he had the seed of and used that uninterrupted time to ideate in his head.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, as I stated in my reply, I&rsquo;ve seen many designers early in their career ruminate on an idea to the point of procrastination. To be clear, I&rsquo;m using procrastination to cover two thoughts here; that the designer is either wasting time by pushing an idea around without actually developing it, or that they&rsquo;re deliberately exploring every avenue despite knowing that many of them will be unsuccessful so that they can prove they&rsquo;ve tried it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet&rsquo;s unpack these a bit.

I struggled with this a lot. I still do some days. Just pushing around rectangles without really making meaningful changes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be that it&rsquo;s unclear what you need to do next. It might be that it&rsquo;s totally clear but seems overwhelming to take the next step, or it might be that you just find the thought simply boring.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis situation is somewhat akin to writer&rsquo;s block. Arguably I think any creative goes through this at some point but when your creativity is boxed into 8-hour time blocks, it&rsquo;s even more likely.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge here is that when you&rsquo;re not making any progress, you&rsquo;ll start iterating on bad ideas. That way, you can demonstrate progress but is it good progress?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, it&rsquo;s important to take a break.

If you&rsquo;re already experiencing a non-iterating procrastination state, it&rsquo;s easy to start falling into a pattern of over-iterating to make up for any shortfall. The issue here&mdash;and this seems especially common early in your career&mdash;is that you end up iterating on bad ideas to solve the problem.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge here is you then start making poor decisions to feel like you&rsquo;ve made any decisions at all. This ends up leading you down bad paths and lots of wasted time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother side to this, especially when you&rsquo;re more junior in your career is that you might lack the internal clout to be able to push back on a bad idea suggested by a colleague, manager or leader. In these instances you&rsquo;ll feel like you \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C\u002Fem\u003E to explore them because you don&rsquo;t have the ability to push back.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn&rsquo;t necessarily procrastination in the usual sense, mostly because it&rsquo;s not self inflicted, but it can end up going that way or have the same effect on your progress.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is challenging because you can&rsquo;t simply earn internal clout overnight, but having the ability to push back when you know an idea is wrong is key. With seniority and clout comes the ability to push back with little or no justification. That&rsquo;s a privileged position to be in and doesn&rsquo;t come easily, or to, everyone.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is the situation your in then I have some suggestions for what to do.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGather a single example of your idea done badly with some simple redlines to point out the issue.

Or how do you even tell if you are?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere&rsquo;s a few tell tale signs of when a design has gone awry.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou can&rsquo;t justify the reason for your decision to yourself\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou can&rsquo;t convince yourself you&rsquo;d use it\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou can&rsquo;t see the potential future\u002Flong term vision for the idea\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou can&rsquo;t confidently tell what question you&rsquo;re answering or what problem this solution solves\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn these situations, again, lean on your team to provide that nudge if you can. If you&rsquo;re a team of one, show someone outside of the project (i.e. a friend or loved one) and see how they&rsquo;d feel. Without context they can often give the most brutal, honest and helpful feedback.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;ve seen people get caught in a context loop many times, I myself have been in that situation, where you justify bad ideas because as part of the wider context you can convince yourself that they make sense.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry talking to a friend or family member about this work and explain with the context. If it takes too long or is incoherent or messy, take a step back and ask yourself whether this has gotten too complex.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to really simplify the problem and avoid bad iteration, step away from your designs entirely and revert to pen and paper. Don&rsquo;t use it to sketch designs though, use it to scratch down thoughts and concepts. Think of it like a way to journal your thoughts around the idea you&rsquo;re solving for and let the thoughts flow. It may take a few goes to get into this mindset but it can really help unpack the idea and take you away from designing a bad idea whilst keeping you inside the same headspace. It might not feel like progress but it actually likely will get you further in the end.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you grow in your career you&rsquo;ll find that your hunches or initial concepts tend to be the ones that stick (most of the time) and you just iterate on that to get to a final solution. That isn&rsquo;t always the case, but you&rsquo;ll learn quickly when something has value or not and whether to push it further or let it go. Earlier in your career though you&rsquo;ll probably find that you get attached to an idea that might not be the right one and find it hard to let go.

I was simply a Product Designer and my seniority was known through skill, knowledge and my ability to provide the Design Ops skills missing in the business. So I was senior in all but title, and that was fine.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter joining \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.moneyboxapp.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EMoneybox\u003C\u002Fa\u003E at a mid-senior level, I realised very quickly that title is relative to the company size. We have a 10-person design team with a range of experience, and again my seniority is relative to that. I&rsquo;ll be pushing for senior in my next performance review, and that&rsquo;ll suit where I am in the org skill and influence-wise, but it could seem like a long way down from where I &ldquo;was&rdquo; before.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;ve learnt to accept that titles are relative and I think it&rsquo;s an important lesson for us all to take away. Joining an org at whatever title may just be reflective of your skill-level relative to that org&rsquo;s incumbent skills. It doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re moving down in your career and in fact that opportunity might afford your more growth in the end.

It&rsquo;s not for everyone, but the idea that we don&rsquo;t have to be tied to one person is an interesting concept to think about. Now, if you take that concept and apply it to your work and personal life then you start to see where Polywork is coming from.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our professional lives, we often identify as a specific career or job role: the Product Designer (like me), the Frontend Developer, the Milkman, or the Beautician. The reality though, is we&rsquo;re often a lot more than that, and even very often in our professional careers, we perform more roles than that title we hold.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you&rsquo;ve read my articles for a while, you&rsquo;ll know that I sit in the land of &ldquo;Product Designer who codes but also writes music&rdquo;. At different points in my career I&rsquo;ve been able to take advantage of all these facets but never once could I call myself that as a job title. It&rsquo;d be weird.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat Polywork encourages is the idea that we can have many skills and do many things, and that we should celebrate that. Whether that be our achievements or our failures. There&rsquo;s plenty of badges for things such as &ldquo;College Dropout&rdquo; or &ldquo;Failed at a job interview&rdquo;. Normalising this is critical to Polyworks differentiation and to its success.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut most important to Polywork&rsquo;s future success is their approach to how they build the platform. And this is where I want to focus.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EWhy are they building in the open?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt&rsquo;s become increasingly common for modern startups to build out in the open, willing to ship half-finished ideas and broken flows to gauge customer interest and determine what features to prioritise.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost famously coined by Facebook&rsquo;s early &ldquo;Move fast and break things&rdquo; methodology, young startups taking this approach are finding their strength in being vulnerable.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom when I joined near the beginning (which, in retrospect, wasn&rsquo;t long ago at all so that goes to show how fast they&rsquo;re iterating), the platform simply offered a timeline you could fill out. That timeline hasn&rsquo;t changed much since those days, it&rsquo;s had steady updates but because the team focused on this as the true MVP of the idea, they remained laser-focused on their initial mission of making it easy for people to showcase all that they do without it being confined to a particular job. It was at this point that I set up the custom domain option so I could set up my \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fchangelog.kejk.tech\"\u003Echangelog\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (more about this later).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then, we saw the first glimpse of what would become the Multiverse, allowing you to see other people&rsquo;s profiles on the platform and now the Space Station for finding people to collaborate with, and basic messaging. In a matter of months, the platform has evolved from a timeline to a pretty full-featured product. And it&rsquo;s safe to say, so much of that has been down to building out in the open. Learning by shipping. Testing, iterating, improving and scrapping. \u003Cem\u003EBeing okay with being vulnerable\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EMy personal changelog\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;ve focused on treating my Polywork profile as a personal, and professional changelog. Whilst my personal website is kept minimal, focused on very specific finished deliverables, there&rsquo;s a host of things I do that live in and around those things and the last thing I want is for my personal site to become littered with it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat&rsquo;s where treating my Polywork as a changelog of achievements fits in perfectly.

What&rsquo;s not to love!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be pretty daunting to go back through your experience and fill in all those key moments but I found that in some ways, it became cathartic. It acted as a reminder of all the things I&rsquo;ve achieved over the years and how I&rsquo;ve got to be where I am today. It&rsquo;s humbling.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on who you are, what you do, and where you are in your journey, Polywork will do different things for you. Start by adding some basic content like your job history to see the timeline fill out and then begin to add the nuances at whatever level of detail you want. Polywork is flexible enough that you can decide how granular you want your profile timeline to be. Make it an extension of who you are.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EWhat you can learn from Polywork&rsquo;s shipping strategy?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few key things I think any business can take away from Polywork&rsquo;s approach to shipping their MVP across the web and mobile.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDon&rsquo;t be afraid to ship a true MVP that offers one feature at the beginning &mdash;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Whilst you&rsquo;re validating your idea and your roadmap, don&rsquo;t get bogged down in waiting to ship all of your features to customers from day one. You can never be 100% certain it will stick. Find your initial niche and ship that first. Then build on top of it.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStart with a single platform and build from there &mdash;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Don&rsquo;t try to release a website, iOS app, Android app, and the kitchen sink too. Focus on a single platform first, validate the idea, then build out other platforms from there. Keeping focused reduces the resource you need upfront and allows you to focus on validation, not implementation.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIf you start with the web, wrap it into a mobile app before going native &mdash;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Learning from Polywork&rsquo;s approach here, the initial iOS beta was a wrapped web-app rather than native iOS and kept implementation simple. It was literally a webview (a PWA essentially) but wrapped to be servable via TestFlight. Since then, the app has evolved into being, even more native feeling (although still a wrapped webview) and provides a much nicer experience. This is the way to ship MVP. Bare minimum and then evolve.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFree marketing is the best marketing &mdash;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Being a startup, or even being a larger company, you need to be lean in how you think about shipping things. Whether you&rsquo;re lean with your resource, with your features, or with your marketing strategy; keeping things simple and minimal will get you further for less. You could spend a lot of money on marketing to make a splash, or, you could follow Polywork&rsquo;s approach and generate hype through word of mouth, exclusivity and ambiguity. Whilst they&rsquo;ve built a lot of things out in the open, the early days were driven by ambiguity. This ambiguity generated intrigue and as people got brought into the fold, the excitement was shared and drove more waitlist signups. Pair that with exclusive personal codes to skip the queue and you&rsquo;ve got a winning marketing strategy. Polywork weren&rsquo;t the first to do this, but as a business, they&rsquo;ve executed it perfectly. My Twitter timeline is a constant thread of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just joined Polywork, it&rsquo;s amazing, use my code to sign up now&rdquo;.

So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing. We&rsquo;re shipping features to make that true. And that embodies for me a culture of customer care and one of shipping necessary features often.

Lots of people say it, and lots of people have varying opinions on what &lsquo;learning to build your idea&rsquo; truly is.

If you take the time to create flexible components, and think about their relationship to each other and their scalability, you&rsquo;ll start to reap the rewards pretty fast. If you can keep lesson 1 in mind too and actually try to create any of these in Vue, React, Swift or similar, then you&rsquo;ll also find limitations that allow you to rethink how you designed it in the first place.

I saw a lot of worry previously about design systems being so good that a developer can build content without a design. Great! That should be the goal. If they can build views without Design mocking them up, Design can focus on defining the intention of the work, it&rsquo;s reason for being, the customer value, the stakeholder needs etc. Designing the intention, not designing the mock.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPithy takeaway: Design systems create room for more intentional work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E3.

You should be in each other&rsquo;s pockets in a positive way, defining and scoping solutions from the outset, together. If you show willing by trying to prototype a component in real code or just showing that you&rsquo;ve considered limitations though good documentation, it&rsquo;ll go a long way.

Often VCs will turn down businesses by not ever saying no, and instead, by offering product feedback so they keep an open door in case you suddenly do find the traction they desire. When they do this, it&rsquo;s easy for stakeholders outside of the Product team to prioritise these seemingly &ldquo;important&rdquo; features.

Either way, every chance you take is a lesson learnt and in many ways is a chance to grow and evolve.

No matter which it is, you learn a lot by taking them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot all chances are created equal though. Gambling is chance (unless you&rsquo;ve got some mad skills) and is more often than not, likely to end badly. Changing careers is a chance that can equally either pay off or lead to a need to flip again. But whatever happens, own the chances you take and look at them from a longer-term perspective.

And designing an experience that feels in concert with\r\nthe physical experience will be essential too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mindset follows on from my belief that all Product Designers should understand the core concepts of the development stack, even if they don&rsquo;t code [\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.kejk.tech\u002Fthoughts\u002Fdesigning-in-code\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E1\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.kejk.tech\u002Fthoughts\u002Fcode-as-design\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E2\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.kejk.tech\u002Fthoughts\u002Fthinking-in-design-code\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E3\u003C\u002Fa\u003E].

With spatial design, it&rsquo;s exactly the same.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we see the rise of AR, VR, MR and audio-only platforms, we&rsquo;ll see the need for designers to think about the spatial experience increase.

I&rsquo;m a designer by trade but I tend to get my feet wet in the development side too. If you&rsquo;ve read my posts previously or even looked on my site, you&rsquo;ll notice the distinct 50\u002F50ish split of design and development\r\nprojects and\u002For posts. Being in control of the majority of the stack when it comes to projects I work on has proven super useful in terms of creative control and individual learning. But one thing I&rsquo;ve always found too abstract and difficult to\r\nlearn is backend development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrontend dev and design go hand in hand. I&rsquo;ve spoken vocally before about my belief that Designers should understand \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.kejk.tech\u002Fthoughts\u002Fcode-as-design\"\u003Ehow their work is built\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and should ideally be \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002F_kejk\u002Fstatus\u002F1380866907377647618?s=21\"\u003Ecomfortable\u003C\u002Fa\u003E experimenting in that world themselves too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackend has always felt more complex to me, and APIs were a terrifying concept, so I went on the hunt for a headless CMS option to power my website and get my start in implementing API-driven updates to my website. I was looking through a host of different\r\noptions but specifically trying to get a good free tier that would enable me to power my website fully without having to pay until I was sure it was the right thing for me. This site makes me &pound;0, so keeping it as free as possible to run is ideal\r\n(coincidentally this site only costs me about &pound;6 a month to run if you divide up the domain cost per year).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring my hunting I came across \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cosmicjs.com\"\u003ECosmic\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and saw that it had a super generous free tier, one that could end up being viable for long-term use. Cosmic is a headless CMS that decouples your content from your frontend. By doing this, it meant I could create content &lsquo;buckets&rsquo; (to use Cosmic&rsquo;s nomenclature) to separate my content into different places and power different projects from it (more on why this is great later!).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow I&rsquo;ve written five pieces of value a headless CMS can bring to your project or projects.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E1. Decouple your architecture\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy decoupling your backend from your frontend you can live in a world of a &ldquo;separation of concerns&rdquo;. This is important. By separating your content from your UI, you avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. I use \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nuxtjs.org\"\u003ENuxt\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to build this website, so I could have used the \u003Ccode\u003Econtent\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E module to write markdown and post into my site. That leaves me reliant on Nuxt or another markdown-driven module, it couples me to the architecture. But by using Cosmic, I&rsquo;m able to write my markdown (like this post for example) in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.getdrafts.com\"\u003EDrafts\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and then \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cosmicjs.com\u002Farticles\u002Fhow-to-post-to-a-cosmic-bucket-directly-from-the-drafts-app-d939e480-3bc8-11eb-a739-b574ca5054de\"\u003Ewrite a little script\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to publish straight to my Cosmic bucket (and which now also runs a webhook in Vercel to republish my site and posts a draft into my \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.buttondown.email\"\u003EButtondown\u003C\u002Fa\u003E backend to create a new subscriber post). Now I&rsquo;m not reliant on Nuxt, so if a new framework shows up, or I decide to go back to vanilla JS again, I can still simply integrate all my content again.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E2. Separate your content into Projects or Buckets\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour CMS may use different nomenclature for what Cosmic calls a Project or a Bucket, but essentially, each time you&rsquo;re working on a new project you don&rsquo;t need to spin up a brand new backend necessarily. By having a single Cosmic instance,\r\nyou can spin up as many Projects or Buckets as you like.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this site I have a single Project with a single Bucket that contains all the necessary objects I need. I can then also target that Project but a separate Object to power my \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.plugins.run\"\u003EPlugins.run\u003C\u002Fa\u003E site. I could also push that Object into its own Bucket if my needs grow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut most importantly, it allowed me to spin up a new Project with some collaborators to build an exciting new \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002F_kejk\u002Fstatus\u002F1387739445944782855?s=21\"\u003EFigma plugin\u003C\u002Fa\u003E project where all content is powered by Cosmic&rsquo;s backend&hellip; how awesome is that!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E3. Automate the upload of content\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the topic of that Figma plugin, we have a lot of files to deal with from the outset (541 so far to be precise) which meant that we needed a way to get this content up quickly and easily. My collaborator \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fneef.co\u002F\"\u003ENeef\u003C\u002Fa\u003E put his skills to work and built a rad upload automation that meant we could easily post all of our files to Cosmic via the \u003Ccode\u003Eadd Object\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E endpoint by just dumping them in a folder locally and running \u003Ccode\u003Enpm run upload:assets\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E. This stopped me\r\nfrom manually doing all 541 (I&rsquo;d already done about 30 manually and that was horrible).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout a headless CMS with a solid API, this would have been entirely manual and painful when each object has 5 points of metadata that need handling. It doesn&rsquo;t sound like a lot, but that&rsquo;s repetition over 2000 times, and this was just for\r\nthe first set of data.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E4. Power anything\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing on from the above, by being able to power my website projects and also now a Figma plugin, it shows that a headless CMS can actually power anything. You could use one to power a website or app&rsquo;s content, power a plugin or integration or\r\neven just as a repository of information you want to store.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next goal is to start thinking about powering content in a native iOS app with my Cosmic CMS. Not sure on the project for this yet, but if you&rsquo;ve got ideas for something, send me an \u003Ca href=\"mailto:karl+appIdeaProject@kejk.tech\"\u003Eemail\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E5. Teach you about APIs\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, learning how to implement your content via a headless CMS teaches you how APIs work and helps you to understand the relationship between content and UI and how this separation of concerns can improve, future-proof and power any project you&rsquo;re\r\nworking on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, don&rsquo;t forget, you can go back and add a headless CMS solution to an older project. I did this with my pre-Nuxt website which used bare Vue (and thus didn&rsquo;t have the SEO benefits Nuxt brings) and it worked like a charm.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003ETime to start something!\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, a headless CMS offers freedom and power. If you&rsquo;re not sure whether one is the right fit for what you&rsquo;re doing, then I challenge you to try and find a way to make sense of it and do it. Everything you create in Cosmic is just a\r\nJSON object that can be returned via the API. So if you&rsquo;re working on anything digital, you can use that JSON to do something. So I&rsquo;d say, anything is possible!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you get stuck or want some advice, feel free to get in touch via the form below or head over to the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cosmicjs.com\u002Farticles\"\u003ECosmic community\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and see what people are building!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Iâve been working now with SwiftUI for a while and I can say I truly love it.

Now there are tonnes of available plugins in the Figma Community but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can find one to solve your problem, some issues are just too unique to your use case.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt HomeHero, we&rsquo;re using a bunch of custom Figma plugins that I&rsquo;ve written (including the ones I&rsquo;ve actually released)\r\nto better maintain our files. I&rsquo;ll cover some of these below.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, Figma plugins stop us from repeating ourselves with common admin tasks to clean up our files, they allow us to focus on designing the best experience instead of organising our contents.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EThe &lsquo;Gist&rsquo; of how plugins work\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of these Gists use the Scripter plugin to work as it has its own API to simplify some bits, grab it \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.figma.com\u002Fcommunity\u002Fplugin\u002F757836922707087381\u002FScripter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ehere\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

We have a bunch of phrases we write in our designs regularly thanks to our industry, and there are many times that we mistype them and this sometimes makes its way to the product\r\n(oh dear!). To avoid that, I&rsquo;ve written a super simple linter that parses the document and updates all text characters that match my arrays.

Limiting Beliefs feature in many self-help books, seminars and even many religions. They&rsquo;re the concept that we convince ourselves that we aren&rsquo;t capable of achieving something or being someone because we &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t good enough at it&rdquo; or &ldquo;don&rsquo;t live in the right city for that kind of job&rdquo; or &ldquo;can&rsquo;t do it because there isn&rsquo;t enough time in the day&rdquo;. Understanding and identifying our limiting beliefs and then&mdash;to use common cult nomenclature&mdash;reprogramming our minds to remove them is a core tenet of how NXIVM started and actually a positive thing I took away.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;ve long had limiting beliefs&mdash;which will be evident from previous articles&mdash;about my ability to be a designer based on my varied job history or that I&rsquo;m not really a frontend developer because I can&rsquo;t do everything from memory (despite knowing that most developers are this way).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELately though, I&rsquo;ve been training myself out of this mindset.

People like familiarity, it&rsquo;s human nature.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign and development for that matter are the same. Design patterns are critical for making something pleasing to the eye. Early in most creative classes you&rsquo;ll learn about the oft touted &ldquo;Golden Ratio&rdquo;. This particular number (1.618)\r\nwhen used as a compositional spacing rule, leads to the most pleasing results mathematically which happen to be aesthetically pleasing too. Why? Pattern recognition.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EUnderstanding this article\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELittered throughout this article are links to other articles and websites.

Lots of clever people have written great pieces on the things I&rsquo;m talking about here, so my goal is to collate a series of these\r\nthoughts into an abstract of sorts.

Nature is an incredible thing and the results are beautiful. If we use those patterns ourselves in music, design and development, we get beautiful results too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets break down some of the similarities between the mediums by picking some core terminology and finding some examples.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EThe rule of thirds\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn photography there&rsquo;s the concept of the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fphotographylife.com\u002Fthe-rule-of-thirds\"\u003ERule of Thirds\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, where you aim to create a pleasing proportion to your image by aligning the subject to different thirds within their containing\r\nframe. Just like all creative rules though, sometimes breaking them leads to more intriguing results, and this is very common when using the rule of thirds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn design we can use the rule of thirds when \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fdesignwebkit.com\u002Fweb-design\u002Frule-of-thirds-web-design\u002F\"\u003Elaying out a website or app\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, or when composing an article. It can often help us to pair the notion of the rule of thirds with grid\r\nlayouts. Pairing the two can lead to interesting and dynamic layouts whilst maintaining logic and legibility.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn music we can use the rule of thirds in many ways, mostly it&rsquo;s a logical way to think about breaking up a composition. Take a traditional \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.teenstarcompetition.co.uk\u002Fadvice\u002Fhow-to-write-a-pop-song\"\u003Epop song\u003C\u002Fa\u003E: intro, verse,\r\nchorus, verse, chorus, bridge, middle eight, chorus. Here, to create the catchy moment people always look forward to in songs, often the end of a pop song leverages the idea of using a bridge, then a middle eight (which is often a stripped down version\r\nof the same chorus melody) and then ending with a big final chorus. This use of a triad is one of the major reasons pop songs feel so catchy, they&rsquo;re predictable.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign and development layouts should also maintain predictability, this predictability is what makes a design usable and pleasing to look at.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EGrids\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on who you are, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.interaction-design.org\u002Fliterature\u002Farticle\u002Fthe-grid-system-building-a-solid-design-layout\"\u003Egrid systems\u003C\u002Fa\u003E are either a blessing or a curse. If we think about them the same as the rule of thirds then we&rsquo;re on the right path. Grids can be used as a definitive approach to layout or be used as an element we purposely break to provide a unique aesthetic approach. Either one is acceptable, it&rsquo;s just up to you and your layout intention.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn music we have a similar principle to grids in instrumental composition. Choosing how to &ldquo;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002FS8fZ62FrquQ\"\u003Earrange\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&rdquo; instruments is vital to the feel of a song. We can choose to have all instruments playing at once,\r\nor start with just one and build it up. Similar to grids, we can use different structural layouts to create the final song, and those different structural layouts dramatically impact the feel of the piece.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EColour theory and white space\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002F99designs.co.uk\u002Fblog\u002Ftips\u002Fthe-7-step-guide-to-understanding-color-theory\u002F\"\u003EColour theory\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, surely there isn&rsquo;t a corollary to anything in music here? Well, not so fast there champ. We can make a comparison here to the idea of\r\nharmony. Colour theory is the idea that selecting colours that are opposites on the colour wheel leads to a pleasing compositional choice as they balance each other out. Why is that? It&rsquo;s because they contain the opposite values, this fills out\r\nthe colour spectrum to its whole.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn music we have a similar thing. Have you ever wondered why the majority of songs contain drums, bass, guitars\u002Fsynths and vocals, for example? It&rsquo;s not by chance, its because these instruments fill the entire audible spectrum humans can perceive.\r\nThere are only so many frequencies that we can hear, by filling space in each of them we can create audible balance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, in both cases, we can play on this idea by breaking these rules at certain moments. Think of the famous &ldquo;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fdj.dancecult.net\u002Findex.php\u002Fdancecult\u002Farticle\u002Fdownload\u002F451\u002F457\"\u003Ebass drop\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&rdquo; in dance music, or dropping to one\r\nguitar before all coming back in, or even moments of complete silence. These are tactics musicians use to create space in the composition and therefore generate the drama and anticipation of when it kicks back in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn design we do this too by using \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fblog.prototypr.io\u002Fimportance-of-white-space-in-design-5a40c0e65bfd\"\u003Ewhite space\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to create a void between the content and colours, creating impact when we drop back in to the palette. We can also do this by dropping to a single colour for a moment and then bringing back the contrast of our secondary opposite colour to fill the visual out.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ERhythm\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can keep all your instruments together following the same rhythm and harmony. This is pleasing to the ear in the fact that it feels together and its easy to nod your head to. Alternatively, you can mix different rhythms or harmony&rsquo;s to produce interesting results. In music we have what&rsquo;s known as a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmathdrumming.com\u002Fpolyrhythms\u002F\"\u003Epolyrhythm\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. This is a rhythmic device where an instrument maintains a rhythm that falls outside of the time signature of the composition\r\nbut, thanks to some maths, falls back into time within a later phrase of the other instruments rhythm.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, in design we can use rhythm and harmony when we think about a layout. When laying out \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.jeroenseynhaeve.com\u002Fpythagoras-and-vertical-rhythm-in-typography\u002F\"\u003Etypography\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, rhythm and harmony are words that often come up. That&rsquo;s\r\nbecause what makes typography often feel pleasing to look at and read is the consistency by which the elements are laid out. If we break this typographic rhythm then it can either have pleasing results (such as for a poster design) or feel unbalanced\r\nand terrible because of a lack of visual consistency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ETime signatures and pacing\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch like rhythm, we can use other mathematical devices to play with our composition. Pacing is key to this, it allows us to think about how fast and slow the entire song should be, but also the speed of each section. Is it full time, is it half time.\r\nPlaying with the pacing is another device we can use to change the feel between sections and drive impact.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you ever listen to music I&rsquo;ve written for Echoes, we play on this idea quite often by leveraging the drama of half time. We love dropping to a final half time ending on a lot of our songs. We do this deliberately because it provides the drama\r\nand release that the build up to the moment expects.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn design we can do this too by building up different layers of composition. By having sections of your design filled with an image, text and buttons, then dropping to a section with just a single centre-aligned paragraph, then an image, and then back\r\ninto a full section with all elements. Doing this creates visual drama and dynamism. It also helps to draw attention to the right things at the right time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEqually, we can play with \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.musicnotes.com\u002Fnow\u002Ftips\u002Fa-complete-guide-to-time-signatures-in-music\u002F\"\u003Etime signatures\u003C\u002Fa\u003E which allow us to create different dynamic rhythms to create more unique feels. Jazz is full of this, but so is a lot of modern metal music.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERap and hip hop use a very common layering of 4\u002F4 backing rhythms and then rapping in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fhellomusictheory.com\u002Flearn\u002Ftriplets\u002F\"\u003Etriplets\u003C\u002Fa\u003E over the top. This is what makes the vocals feel like they&rsquo;re running at a faster pace than the lyrics and feel really fluid. You can count 1, 2, 3 in fast succession over the 4 measures to hear how it works.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn design we can use this idea visually by using contrasting grids on top of each other. Think how it would look to have your type laid out evenly over a 4 block grid but spaced as if it was a 3 block grid. It would create interest by adding additional\r\nwhite space between the words, creating a more intriguing rhythm.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ECombining our principles\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the below example, the navigation bar at the top and the two circular graphics fall on the 4x4 grid whereas the title text sits on a 3x4 grid. Just like triplets fall inside a 4\u002F4 rhythm, different grids can work in harmony to create more interesting\r\nlayouts. This combines our principles of grids, rhythm, pacing, colour theory, white space and time signatures.

In Figma, a &ldquo;Project&rdquo; is a folder that contains a series of files that you work on. You can have one, several or many. In Code, we use folders (just a regular old computer folder) and inside those folders\r\nwe keep files which contain our code. Like with a Figma project, a folder can contain one, several or many files.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you work in modern Javascript-based frameworks, you&rsquo;ll likely have a whole bunch of files. If you&rsquo;re just keeping it minimal you may only use a single HTML file.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFiles == Files\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell this ones easier right? Each Figma file inside your project is essentially synonymous with the file structure of a development project. You can create multiple files within a project and link them all together with Figma&rsquo;s Shared Libraries feature.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor most development projects, especially those that utilise one of the Javascript frameworks, there will be a bunch of files that all play together nicely (hopefully) to build your site. Figma projects are no different if you take full advantage of the\r\nShared Libraries in Figma (and you should). Decentralising files is a key fundamental in modern development and allows for greater reusability and manageability of your code. Thinking of design files like this too will not only make your files more manageable\r\nbut will also create a wider synergy to your development project when it progresses.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFrames == Divs\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrames in Figma are your canvases. Frames are where you &ldquo;paint&rdquo; the interface of the product or thing you&rsquo;re designing, and in development the notion of &ldquo;painting&rdquo; is true too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESidenote: You may see the phrase &ldquo;Time to first paint&rdquo; if you ever do a Google Lighthouse review of your site, this is Google telling you the time it takes for your site to load the initial interface and allow first interaction. If it&rsquo;s\r\nslow, you&rsquo;ll score low for SEO and with Javascript-based Single Page Apps this can be a problem, so keep an eye on it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like in Figma, Divs act as a container for your code and you can stack as many Divs inside each other as you need (just like Frames). By doing this, you build up a structure for your page. This is where it can start to take life. It&rsquo;s important\r\nto stay focused on building out the core Div structure before getting into the details. Use quick &ldquo;styles&rdquo; on your Divs to create visual separation&mdash;even if it looks garish&mdash;such as `class=&ldquo;border-2 border-black bg-red-500&rdquo;.\r\nI&rsquo;d use primary colours to separate the independent elements and stop you from nitpicking the details.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fkemiljk\u002F67631887f63e7b3b047364ef5df764f4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EThis Gist\u003C\u002Fa\u003E is an example of building up the basic structure of my home page container utilising the TailwindCSS library.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EAuto Layout == Flexbox and Grid\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the above code you&rsquo;ll see some examples of &lsquo;flex&rsquo;, &lsquo;flex-row&rsquo; and &lsquo;grid&rsquo;. These are all layout mechanisms that help to structure the page content in a more fluid and dynamic way. They&rsquo;re particularly important for when you want to create responsive layouts, such as having a 1 x 4 grid turn from a single row into a single column between desktop and mobile. This is exactly what happens in that first grid line \u003Ccode class=\"  language-html\"\u003E&lt;divclass=&quot;grid xs:grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4&quot;&gt;\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E.\r\nAt the smallest breakpoint (phone) it&rsquo;s a single column, at the next breakpoint (tablet portrait) it&rsquo;s two, and then at the next and up (tablet landscape or desktop) it turns into a four-column row. At each stage I implement a 4-point gap\r\nto separate the elements.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at the new Figma Auto Layout and Constraints controls, you&rsquo;ll see a lot of familiarity with these flex principles too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cfigure\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fkejk\u002Fimage\u002Fupload\u002Fv1608155456\u002F7BDEFC0F-89CB-4CA5-B93C-1B2A55646CEE_ewz2ye.jpg\" alt=\"An image of the Flexbox-like layout\" class=\"w-screen md:max-w-xl rounded-lg fr-fic fr-dii\"\u003E\u003Cfigcaption\u003EAn image of the Flexbox-like layout\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the above we can see the flex direction (the down and right arrow) the spacing between elements (in grid, this is the grid-space-row or grid-space-col or in TailwindCSS, gap-{n}), the overall padding (here it&rsquo;s 16px on every side) and the alignment\r\n(in our example this is align-center, justify-center).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also set resizing constraints. This defines how the object behaves when resized. We can choose between &ldquo;Hug contents&rdquo;&mdash;where the frame itself (i.e. the Div) is perfectly connected to the width of the objects inside and maintains\r\nthe padding and wrapping&mdash;or &ldquo;Fixed width&rdquo; where the the frame width never changes regardless of changes to the internal components. The same rules can be applied to the height property.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is how this looks in practice. Hug Contents is above and Fixed Width below.

I know, I know, it&rsquo;s totally boring and it&rsquo;s fine to have &lsquo;Rectangle 33201&rsquo; or &lsquo;Frame 1000010&rsquo; on your projects if the actual designs look cool. I&rsquo;ve done it many\r\ntimes too. But there is a really valid reason to think more carefully about layer naming, implementation in code.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can handover a file that&rsquo;s name logically from a layering perspective (especially if you&rsquo;ve taken all the above steps too) then you&rsquo;ll find your Engineer(s) have a much easier time implementing the code as they can use it as their\r\nfile architecture or map.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGroups should be given a name that characterises the contents. This is what can relate directly to an &lsquo;ID&rsquo; property or a &lsquo;Class&rsquo;. IDs by their very nature must be unique. In real life you can only have a single form of ID from\r\na single source, the same applies to code. You should use an ID once in your code and not again. If you find yourself repeating them then you should swap these to become classes instead.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn ID gives your particular Div or object a unique identifier which determines what makes it different. You could name a Nav Div, for example, \u003Ccode class=\"  language-text\"\u003ENAV\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E as you should only have one implementation of your core Navigation and reuse that component everywhere (more on this later). If that is true, ID it as \u003Ccode class=\"  language-text\"\u003ENAV\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E and apply the relevant classes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice the use of uppercase. Everyone has different practices, but one I think is particularly useful is to use UPPERCASE words to represent IDs and kebab-case for classes. But really you can do what you want. The reason for a difference? Scanability.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EStyles == Classes\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, in Figma, if you find yourself reusing a particular style everywhere then you&rsquo;ve probably decided (at least I hope so) to create a Figma Style from it. Doing this allows you to create local Text Styles, Color Styles and Effect Styles for a\r\ndocument. That way, repetition is more easy to do and consistency is more likely to be had.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn code we do this too, they&rsquo;re known as classes. Depending on whether you&rsquo;re using a CSS library (like \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftailwindcss.com\u002F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ETailwindCSS\u003C\u002Fa\u003E) or not will likely determine your approach to classes. Tailwind uses what are known as &lsquo;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fadamwathan.me\u002Fcss-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns\u002F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EUtility Classes\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&rsquo;, essentially breaking classes up into atomic parts (see: \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fatomicdesign.bradfrost.com\u002F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAtomic Design\u003C\u002Fa\u003E). What this means in practice is, like in my example earlier, there&rsquo;s lots of bitty classes used to\r\nbuild up a base idea.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust look at this button: \u003Ccode class=\"  language-html\"\u003E&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot;class=&quot;flex flex-row w-full justify-center text-center font-medium btn btn-primary rounded-xl px-6 py-3 bg-blue-400 text-white hover:bg-blue-500 focus:outline-none focus:shadow-outline transition duration-500 ease&quot;&gt;Button 1\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&lt;\u002F\u003C\u002Fspan\u003Ebutton\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&gt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat&rsquo;s a big ol&#39; lot of classes to get the button behaving how I want. But equally, it behaves how I want. I&rsquo;ve have complete control in the place I&rsquo;m creating the button, instead of relying on styling in a separate CSS file. And, once you learn the notation style, it actually gets pretty fast to write (see: \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fbrianlovin.com\u002Foverthought\u002Ftailwind-css-first-impressions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EBrian Lovin on migrating to TailwindCSS\u003C\u002Fa\u003E).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next logical step, of course, is to reduce the amount you do this. And you do this, just like in Figma, through making reusable elements called Components.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EComponents == Components\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow on to the final piece of the puzzle. You&rsquo;ve written a bunch of stuff, but you find yourself copying and pasting it all the time. Doesn&rsquo;t it seem silly to do that? Couldn&rsquo;t it be easier?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where component based design and development comes in. Breaking things up into reusable chunks makes it easier to manage a big build and increases consistency. The beauty of Components too, is that you can decide how atomic you want to make them.\r\nAtomic Design (mentioned earlier) is the extreme end of the spectrum, but if you&rsquo;re already using TailwindCSS then you&rsquo;ve already got a bunch of atomic elements to play with.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I dissect my site, I have:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFour core unique pages\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOne subpage (for blog posts)\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFourteen components\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could be much more atomic with my components. If it was a commercial product, I would be, but the reality is that I don&rsquo;t need to be that strict about it. I&rsquo;m building it to my needs, just like I would a personal Figma file. The most important\r\npart of creating a component of anything is thinking about who&rsquo;s going to use it. Think of your website the same way you think of a Figma Design System. If you created icons with their labels as components, do the same, they&rsquo;ll be easier to\r\nswap out in a conditional statement. If you created different card component types, do the same, again you can use conditionals to control data differences.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EConclusion\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you&rsquo;re working with engineers on a project, talk it through with them. Ask them how they&rsquo;re planning to execute at a code level and build your project to match. If they&rsquo;re going atomic, go atomic. It&rsquo;ll feel tough in the beginning\r\nbut the 1:1 match will be worth it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost importantly though, learn to make these connections in your head. If you can map what you think of in design to what the end engineering build case could be, you&rsquo;ll find that the process of documenting design decisions and handing over projects\r\nbecome far easier.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",modified_at:"2021-12-21T13:42:42.461Z",metadata:{published:"2020-12-18",snippet:"My personal approach on how to think about code from a design perspective and how to implement those changes.",tag:c,hero:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.cosmicjs.com\u002Fd60a4250-b580-11eb-b5b6-fd115d17c053-Thinking-in-design-code2x.png",imgix_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimgix.cosmicjs.com\u002Fd60a4250-b580-11eb-b5b6-fd115d17c053-Thinking-in-design-code2x.png"},latest:a}},{slug:"dont-let-your-role-define-you",title:"Donât let your role define you",content:"\u003Cp\u003EThis article started off life as an essay on my career.

None of this was by accident but it certainly wasn&#39;t planned. I just kept pushing for and pursuing the path I wanted and felt most\r\ncomfortable in. You need to do the same. A lot of employers admire people who&#39;ve trodden a unique path because they bring skills others wouldn&#39;t. Be that person.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFight the voice inside that tells you that you&#39;re not worthy&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere isn&#39;t a day that I don&#39;t experience imposter syndrome. I&#39;m constantly in disbelief that I&#39;m actually a designer somewhere. I&#39;m still convinced I &quot;shouldn&#39;t be allowed&quot; because I followed an unconventional path.\r\nBut I am a designer, I do that job and I do it well. It&#39;s hard to fight the negative feelings but you have to remember that you were hired for a reason. You didn&#39;t lie to get there (hopefully), so just keep doing what you do. Someone will tell\r\nyou if you&#39;re not up to scratch.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EDon&#39;t be afraid to learn&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one is probably obvious, but seriously, keep learning. I&#39;ve never stopped trying to get to the bottom of things and become better at the core skills I need to deliver my job. But equally, I keep pushing to learn more. Teaching myself SwiftUI\r\nso I can feel closer to engineering&#39;s implementation of our designs, teaching myself Javascript frameworks to be able to build my own personal site and understand the basics of APIs. These are all fundamental to the products we ship, as designers\r\nwe should know how they work too. Speak in the same language as your developers, it&#39;ll save you all so much time and build a stronger team. Trust me.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EBe comfortable with being uncomfortable&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet uncomfortable. Push yourself to that point. Then sit there, in it, for a while. Get used to that feeling, it&#39;ll help massively with that voice that tells you you&#39;re not worthy. The more you get used to feeling uncomfortable, the more you&#39;ll be comfortable with it. Psychologists often use \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.psychologytools.com\u002Fprofessional\u002Ftechniques\u002Fexposure\u002F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eexposure therapy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to help people overcome their fears. Slowly introducing them to the thing that makes them uncomfortable for longer and longer times until they eventually become comfortable. Do that to yourself. Offer to do a Lunch and Learn on a topic to the entire team, take on that Webflow project when you&#39;ve never used it before, offer to man the phones for a couple of hours to deal with customers. Whatever makes you uncomfortable, push yourself to try it, you&#39;ll see it&#39;s not that bad and you&#39;ll grow tenfold because of it.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EDon&#39;t give up&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you&#39;ve not had that flip yet and you&#39;re still in a role you feel defines you even though it&#39;s not the &quot;you&quot; you want to be; don&#39;t give up. Seriously. It can feel like it&#39;s never going to happen. Trust me, I&#39;ve been\r\nthere. But if you focus on the earlier steps and commit to that journey, you&#39;ll get there. Seek opportunities in your current business to push into areas you want to be in, even be as bold as to ask your manager if there is any chance.

Using &ldquo;View Source&rdquo; I could steal the code other people wrote and modify it to my needs.

The leap from HTML and CSS to React was massive and it put me off.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvuejs.org\"\u003EVue\u003C\u002Fa\u003E! I stumbled across Vue by accident. I knew I wanted to learn something more reactive so I started searching around, found Vue and it just clicked instantly. I dropped the CDN script into a prototype project I was working on at \u003Ca href=\"www.neuerenergy.com\"\u003ENeuerEnergy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and I was away. I could write the HTML and CSS I knew, and then inject some Javascript in&mdash;when I wanted to and had learned to&mdash;to power up the site with clever reactivity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then my love of Vue began and I decided the best way to learn it better was to rebuild my personal website in Vue. So welcome \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fkejk.kejk.now.sh\"\u003EKEJK v2\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. I decided that because we&rsquo;d been leveraging the power of Material Design at NeuerEnergy, I wanted to do the same for my personal website (avoiding too much brain overload) and thus found the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvuetifyjs.com\u002Fen\u002F\"\u003EVuetify library\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to help me on my journey. This meant I could build in the same way I could design, using a design framework that already made sense to me. If I wanted a card, Vuetify had a \u003Ccode class=\" py-2  language-html\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&lt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003Ev-card\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&gt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E to offer me, if I wanted to break into a grid, I had \u003Ccode class=\" py-2  language-html\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&lt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003Ev-row\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&gt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E and \u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token tag\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&lt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003Ev-col\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"token punctuation\"\u003E&gt;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fcode\u003Eto\r\nhelp me out. It all just made sense.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EVue, Nuxt, Cosmic, Drafts and TailwindCSS\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI loved that personal site, it also provided me with a lot of interest from prospective employers when applying for other design roles. Being able to tell them that I&rsquo;d built the website myself and used Vue to do so gave me a level of skill that other designers weren&rsquo;t always able to offer. This doesn&rsquo;t mean I was \u003Cem\u003Ebetter\u003C\u002Fem\u003E in any way, I just offered \u003Cem\u003Edifferent\u003C\u002Fem\u003E skills and sometimes those skills are super helpful for the right design team.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found that exact design team. In my current role at \u003Ca href=\"www.homehero.co.uk\"\u003EHomeHero\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, I was hired specifically because I could span the breadth of design and development. Connecting Design and Engineering teams is often an overwhelming and complex task. More often than not, projects aren&rsquo;t handed over properly and a lot of important information is either lost in translation or just straight up missed. Usually, this isn&rsquo;t the fault of anyone particularly, better processes could help (I&rsquo;ll be writing about this at some point soon) but also understanding the language of development and being able to understand \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhat it takes\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E to deliver on your grand &ldquo;cross-device isometric animated timeline&rdquo; can have a massive, lasting impact on the connectedness of your team and the quality of the outcome. Moreover, I&rsquo;m able to work directly with the Engineering team to style the frontend of some of our projects, lifting a weight off of them and giving Design the power to own the interface from idea to execution.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what was next for me? Well, as you can see there were two iterations of my previous site but you&rsquo;re reading this on the third. I realised that I had an opportunity to improve things. I wanted to make my content more reactive and allow myself more opportunities to utilise a headless CMS to power a lot of the content that could change regularly. This is when I came across \u003Ca href=\"www.cosmicjs.com\"\u003ECosmicJS\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Cosmic is a super flexible, \u003Cstrong\u003Ereally well documented\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E headless CMS (with an unbelievably generous free tier). Cosmic has allowed me to power pages such as my \u003Ca href=\"www.kejk.tech\u002Fthoughts\"\u003EThoughts\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (where you&rsquo;re reading this) and \u003Ca href=\"www.kejk.tech\u002Fuses\"\u003EUses\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Now I can update content via Cosmic&rsquo;s\r\nsimple backend, avoiding any need to dive into the code to create a new blog post or update my gear.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, I&rsquo;m writing this on \u003Ca href=\"www.getdrafts.com\"\u003EDrafts\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for iPad and will be posting it to my Cosmic bucket using a custom \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Factions.getdrafts.com\u002Fa\u002F1fP\"\u003EPOST action\u003C\u002Fa\u003E I wrote. This makes things frictionless for me now.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;ve also refactored the site to use \u003Ca href=\"www.nuxtjs.org\"\u003ENuxt.js\u003C\u002Fa\u003E so I can take better advantage of dynamic page routing, SEO meta info and their module system. I even went as far as to ditch my use of Material Design and refactored all of the HTML to use \u003Ca href=\"www.tailwindcss.com\"\u003ETailwindCSS\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. This means I&rsquo;m looking up docs less and focusing on writing code in a way my brain already thinks&hellip; in CSS.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ESo what&rsquo;s the future?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;m not really sure where I go next with things. I can probably better implement Cosmic into my site, making more content dynamic. I also want to write some more Drafts actions to try and make things like updating a post more straightforward. But\r\nother than that, I&rsquo;m feeling really excited about where things are and what I&rsquo;ve managed to teach myself.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;ve said it before several times, but I urge you if you&rsquo;re a designer who&rsquo;s working with developers; learn the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, try out a framework like Vue + Nuxt (give SwiftUI a try too). They&rsquo;re all becoming\r\nso much more accessible to people without programming knowledge already (or a more visually-focused brain like me) and I promise it&rsquo;ll be worth it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can do it, so can you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",modified_at:"2021-12-21T13:43:30.500Z",metadata:{published:"2020-12-10",snippet:"How development can be learned through a design lens (and how I've managed to do it).

Arguably, the vast majority of Creatives are precious people.

The very nature of having two individuals meant that we were somewhat forced into working in the open. We, in most cases, would be working across the same files because of the needs of the organisation\r\nat the time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing we did though, was use Figma. By default, Figma&rsquo;s goal is to enable and encourage working out in the open. Whether that&rsquo;s through the cross-platform, web-based tool&rsquo;s easy sharing options, or the multi-cursor features, it became\r\nsuper easy for us to bring product managers and developers into the fold too.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we&rsquo;ve grown, we&rsquo;ve ensured that we maintain this approach to working. Although we only open access to our files once they&rsquo;re in the right shape, we actively seek product manager and developer input during the early stages of design.\r\nAllowing them in to the fold when the file is still a mess of ideas and mistakes ensures that we don&rsquo;t spend too long going down the wrong path or thinking we&rsquo;ve understood the brief but we&rsquo;ve actually got it hugely wrong.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EBeing consistent\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all well and good, but it&rsquo;s easy to lose consistency with this and retreat back to the WIP-obsessed designer mindset.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe&rsquo;ve done it as a team. We started with really open access in Figma. Anyone with a HomeHero email address could just jump in to any file and have a nose around and have their say. We experienced a few moments where we got some unhelpful feedback\r\non parts of a project that were just experiments. And the problem is, no matter what the page was labelled or what text is included on the page, it&rsquo;s not always clear to an outsider that something is an experiment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt&rsquo;s not an issue just for us as designers. Receiving unnecessary feedback isn&rsquo;t helpful, and it&rsquo;s also a huge waste of time for the person who spent their precious hours adding comments to something that was a passing idea anyway.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFinding a happy medium\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to maintain our openness across the organisation, whilst also ensuring we don&rsquo;t fall into the old traps, we&rsquo;ve spent some time crafting a way forwards.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch4\u003EOur default position is that only Design have Figma access to our Team now.\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that only the design team have open access across all the Figma documents we&rsquo;ve created. This allows us to be working out in the open within the confines of the Design Team. It stops us from keeping our ideas just to ourselves, obsessing\r\nover them until they&rsquo;re &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;, but it also ensures we don&rsquo;t end up in the land of unnecessary comments.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch4\u003EWe add the relevant PM, Developer and and others to a singular, specific file.\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy only adding the right people to the right file at the right time, we guarantee that we&rsquo;ve put the file into the right kind of state to receive the feedback we need, but without resorting to &nbsp;\u003Ccode class=\"  language-text\"\u003E`homepage_redesign-final_FINAL.fig`\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch4\u003EWe design together, live.\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing we spend a lot of time doing now&mdash;beyond collaborating inside the same design files&mdash;is actually designing whilst sharing our screen.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we&rsquo;re working through a specific problem, we&rsquo;ve found that screen sharing-based design sessions work great.

What are the things that they say to hook potential or existing customers? And why does this matter?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, let&rsquo;s start with a story. Early on in my career, I was a sales person. I left University with a Masters in Fine Art but didn&rsquo;t feel I was worthy of a design or development role (despite developing skills in both places for around 10\r\nyears prior) so I went from my full-time retail job at Apple to working as an Account Executive in pharmaceutical advertising. My job was to keep projects on track, win new business and keep clients happy. I was solely responsible for selling the vision\r\nof our design and development teams and ensure coordination and clarification across the board.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it came to meetings, I had to work hard to explain how something had been done, why it would take 2 months to build &ldquo;that&rdquo; feature and why they couldn&rsquo;t have the &ldquo;other&rdquo; feature they wanted. Throughout that process,\r\nI learnt the intricacies and nuances of behaviour, of the complexity of communicating something widely understood by designers and developers, but deeply misunderstood by customers. I expanded skills learnt from Apple Retail about how to explain the complex\r\nin a simple way, breaking technology down to its simplest form and developing similes and metaphors for different approaches. All of this led to accurate communication and valuable insight into the customer experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, fast forward to now. Now I design and develop the frontend experience of products. From initial idea through to final execution. Throughout this process, I have regular touch points with our sales team to ensure that each feature is developed deeply\r\ninline with the requirements of our target market and explain why we&rsquo;ve designed it one way, or developed it another. Why it can&rsquo;t be exactly like that thing they showed me that one time that kind of did the same thing. Why it&rsquo;s going\r\nto take six months to develop that special graph that takes data from 56 sources, runs a machine learning algorithm to extract the most valuable insights, feeds it back into the UI and generates a personalised graph in real-time with up-to-the-second\r\ndata.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I also go to those meetings, sit in on those calls, talk to those potential customers and explain these things myself. Explain our UI decisions in detail. Spend hours in workshops justifying decisions and ensuring our customers see why. And in these\r\nworkshops, our sales team learn. They learn how we think about design and development decisions, why we push back when we do, and how to communicate this to customers. They learn to not promise the earth and that it&rsquo;ll be delivered in 2 weeks. They\r\nlearn to speak in a language that is both technical and customer-centric.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens, is both sides learn how to communicate better. With each other, with the customer, with their peers. Designers and developers learn how to sell.

I&rsquo;d been feeling in a pretty positive place and so the songs I was writing, whilst heavy,\r\nweren&rsquo;t dealing with anything difficult. It&rsquo;s evident when you hear them, they&rsquo;re more upbeat and rotate around a major chord.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I listen back to \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Falbum.link\u002Ftqh6ggrq7kcc9\"\u003ECornerstone\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which we re-recorded for it&rsquo;s 2022 vinyl re-release, I can hear the difference in level of positivity. It&rsquo;s dynamically much more upbeat and musically rotates\r\naround much more major themes, both musically and thematically.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough we write as a unit, and I don&rsquo;t contribute lyrically, the main skeleton songs I write at the start tend to have a dramatic impact on the overall final outcome. Thematically I set the scene, and the rest of the guys come in and chop and\r\nchange things until we&rsquo;re all happy with the final outcome. But regardless of that process, what I define upfront tends to set the stage for what the final form will be. So, if I&rsquo;m feeling wildly optimistic then that&rsquo;ll be reflective,\r\nif I&rsquo;m feeling concerned or solemn, that&rsquo;ll come through too. Unlike any other medium I work in, be that design or development, music is my catharsis.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorking with design systems and predefined toolsets, design and development don&rsquo;t really offer that same level of catharsis for me. They&rsquo;re much more clinical and definite. Not entirely void of emotion, but not filled with heart like my music\r\nis. This is in part because whilst I&rsquo;m a designer that loves design, and I&rsquo;m a frontend developer that loves development, music is my passion project and the thing that gives me emotional release.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe decided to re-release Cornerstone in memory of my father. We knew we were going to re-release before I lost my father, but once that happened it became a great opportunity to take a step back and rethink that album again. When we originally recorded\r\nit, it was our first attempt at a self recorded album that could be released rather than just demoed. As a result, whilst we knew a lot about music production from all our demoing over the years, we had lots of gaps in our knowledge and skills. Since\r\nreleasing Cornerstone we&rsquo;d learned a lot and gotten much better at async recording and production. This meant we could more confidently deliver the album we wished we had the first time around. So we decided to make the version we wished it had\r\nbeen before. And I&rsquo;m so glad we did.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it came to our latest record, as I said earlier, it started in a place of optimism and hope. There was a new drug on the horizon that might extend my dad&rsquo;s life, at least for another year or two based on study data. He was desperate for just\r\none last summer and we were desperate for him to have that, and it seemed like it was possible. He wasn&rsquo;t in the best place but he was coming through it like he always did.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, that day never came to pass. My father collapsed one morning and never recovered. Watching the strongest person you&rsquo;ve known, the person who literally and metaphorically gave you your own strength, revert to a state of confusion and have\r\nan inability to speak and respond is immeasurably hard to handle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that moment we spent a week or so watching him decline. Going through that process is still hard to process and often when I go to sleep those are the moments I see the most. It gets harder and harder to remember those good times and the positive\r\nmemories, but music becomes my outlet in those moments.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the tracks aren&rsquo;t in the order they were written, it&rsquo;ll be evident when I started writing post-passing. The songs have a darker tonality, tend to be much heavier and generally less musically positive. But this is purely part of that\r\ncatharsis for me.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;m not writing to be negative, I&rsquo;m writing to help me process that negativity, that heartbreak, that anguish. Often popular songs are written about the anguish of breakups and in some ways, these songs are my breakup songs. They&rsquo;re\r\na way for me to breakup with the past and look forwards toward the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings will never be the same, but my father was from the school of Stoicism. He didn&rsquo;t believe in hanging on the past or looking too far in the future, he believed in the power of the Now. Living each day for what it is. And that&rsquo;ll be how\r\nI continue to move forwards. Living each day doesn&rsquo;t mean doing something of importance every day, it can mean doing nothing too but doing nothing with absolute intention.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd music will continue to be my outlet, my catharsis, my process of grieving. It provides that creative freedom and feeling that I can&rsquo;t get anywhere else. If you&rsquo;re dealing with anything in life, look for your cathartic outlet. It can be\r\nanything, and it&rsquo;s often likely to be something you don&rsquo;t try to force into an outlet but just finds itself like that naturally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","2022-01-28T18:34:29.543Z","https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.cosmicjs.com\u002Fd1f54750-7975-11ec-bc8e-0b22aad4e2bd-On-creativity-as-a-process-for-catharsis2x.png","https:\u002F\u002Fimgix.cosmicjs.com\u002Fd1f54750-7975-11ec-bc8e-0b22aad4e2bd-On-creativity-as-a-process-for-catharsis2x.png","2021-12-23","The more I listen to our third album, the more I recognise the fact that I wrote it as a form of catharsis.","Object"));
